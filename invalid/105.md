# If the honorarium is to small compared with the total number of units, then no values will be added for the shareholders because of the rounding down

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol uses the Superfluid protocol to distribute the honorarium to the Creator Circle, to do that, it first needs to create a pool where all the members of the circle will get a certain number of shares and the pool will hold a `indexValue`, with each different [distribution](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/blob/54fd3865fc7f0a4616914876859f6fdc9c886de8/packages/ethereum-contracts/contracts/agreements/InstantDistributionAgreementV1.sol#L253), the [`indexValue` is updated based on an `indexDelta`](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/blob/54fd3865fc7f0a4616914876859f6fdc9c886de8/packages/ethereum-contracts/contracts/agreements/InstantDistributionAgreementV1.sol#L269).  
The [`indexDelta`](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/blob/54fd3865fc7f0a4616914876859f6fdc9c886de8/packages/ethereum-contracts/contracts/agreements/InstantDistributionAgreementV1.sol#L268) is calculated based on the formula [`amount / totalUnits`](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/blob/54fd3865fc7f0a4616914876859f6fdc9c886de8/packages/ethereum-contracts/contracts/agreements/InstantDistributionAgreementV1.sol#L268).  The  'amount' represents the honorarium, as it is a percentage of the bid, it can be a very low number and if the `totalUnits` will be higher the the percentage of the bid ( fee or honorarium ) then, because of the rounding down in solidity, the [`indexDelta`](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/blob/54fd3865fc7f0a4616914876859f6fdc9c886de8/packages/ethereum-contracts/contracts/agreements/InstantDistributionAgreementV1.sol#L268) will be 0,  so the [`newIndexValue`](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/blob/54fd3865fc7f0a4616914876859f6fdc9c886de8/packages/ethereum-contracts/contracts/agreements/InstantDistributionAgreementV1.sol#L299) will have the same value as the old `indexValue` adding no additional value to the shareholders but the tokens have been transferred. 
## Impact

 If the fee (honorarium) is very small, then the shareholders will lose value because the distribution is taking place each cycle.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Before calling the distribute function, in `_closeAuction` flow, first call the function [calculateDistribution](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/blob/54fd3865fc7f0a4616914876859f6fdc9c886de8/packages/ethereum-contracts/contracts/agreements/InstantDistributionAgreementV1.sol#L210-L229), to simulare a distribution and if the returned value of actualAmount will be 0, don't distribute the honorarium that cycle
