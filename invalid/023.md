# Protocol funds can be stolen through malicious bidding

## Summary
Malicious actor can inflate their availableCollateral and withdraw funds on the back of the protocol
## Vulnerability Detail
Imagine the following scenario:
Malicious actors Bob and Alice, Bob is the current owner of an auctioned NFT.
Bob transfers NFT ownership to Alice
Alice bids and passes this [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L319-L328)
Alice pays only feeAmount as collateral (which is a fraction of bidAmount)
Alice transfers the NFT back to Bob
Alice wins the auction while Bob is NFT owner and the following logic executes
```solidity
else if (
            l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound].bidder != oldBidder // makes sure highestBid belongs to a user who is not ownerOf the NFT
        ) {
            // Transfer bid to previous bidder's collateral
            l.availableCollateral[oldBidder] += l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound].bidAmount; // bidAmount is transferred to Bob's availableCollateral 
            l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound].collateralAmount = 0;
            l.bids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound][l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound].bidder].collateralAmount = 0;
        }
```
Bob's availableCollateral is incremented by bidAmount despite Alice submitting only a fraction of it as collateral 
## Impact
Loss of funds
## Code Snippet
```solidity
if (IStewardLicense(address(this)).exists(tokenId)) {
            currentBidder = IStewardLicense(address(this)).ownerOf(tokenId);
        } else {
            currentBidder = l.initialBidder;
        }

        if (bidder == currentBidder) {
            // If current bidder, collateral is entire fee amount
            feeAmount = totalCollateralAmount;
        }
        ...
        
else if (
            l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound].bidder != oldBidder // makes sure highestBid belongs to a user who is not ownerOf the NFT
        ) {
            // Transfer bid to previous bidder's collateral
            l.availableCollateral[oldBidder] += l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound].bidAmount; // bidAmount is transferred to Bob's availableCollateral 
            l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound].collateralAmount = 0;
            l.bids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound][l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound].bidder].collateralAmount = 0;
        }

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Entire function logic is flawed, needs revision
