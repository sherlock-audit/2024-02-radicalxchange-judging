# Malicious admin can cheat other bidders out of aunction by setting exhorbitant Mininimum Bid increment.

setMinBidIncrement() is used to set the minimum amount which a bid can be increased. This can exploited by a malicious admin who increases the minimum bid that can be added to exorbitant amounts after becoming the highest bidder.
## Vulnerability Detail
setMinBidIncrement() has an access control modifier which is the contract admin: COMPONENT_ROLE./OWNER.  A contract admin who is also participating in the aunction through a different address can decide to increase the minimum bid to exorbitant amount, thereby warding off others wanting to improve on their bids. In a scenario where no one is willing to improve on their bids the Malicious admin wins the aunction.
## Impact
This is critical as malicious admin through this can alter aunction results at almost every instance.

## Code Snippet
This  function calls the internal  _setMinBidIncrement()  which changes minimum bid increment.

```solidity
function setMinBidIncrement(
        uint256 minBidIncrement_
    ) external onlyRole(COMPONENT_ROLE) {
        _setMinBidIncrement(minBidIncrement_);
    }
``` 
```solidity
function _setMinBidIncrement(uint256 minBidIncrement) internal {
        EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage
            .layout()
            .minBidIncrement = minBidIncrement;

        emit MinBidIncrementSet(minBidIncrement);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review, vs code

## Recommendation
!_isAuctionPeriod(),  should be implemented in setMinBidIncrement() to check if aunction is ongoing before setting new minimum bid increment.
```solidity
  function setMinBidIncrement(
        uint256 minBidIncrement_
    ) external onlyRole(COMPONENT_ROLE) {
! _isAuctionPeriod(tokenId),
            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: can only set Min bid when not in auction period'

        _setMinBidIncrement(minBidIncrement_);
    }
```
