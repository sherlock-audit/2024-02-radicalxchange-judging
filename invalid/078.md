# Auction Logic Flaw

High

## Summary
The `_placeBid` function does not verify if the auction is active, allowing bids at any time, users may place bids outside the designated auction period. 
This could result in funds being locked in the contract without the possibility of winning the auction, effectively causing a loss of funds and disrupting the intended auction mechanics.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol` the `_placeBid` function does not verify if the auction is active, allowing bids at any time, If `_placeBid` is intended to only accept bids during an active auction period, it should incorporate a check using `_isAuctionPeriod` to ensure that bids are only placed when the auction is indeed active.

## Impact
`Funds could be locked without the ability to win the auction,  causing a loss of funds and disrupting the intended auction mechanics`.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L286
```solidity
function _placeBid(...) internal {
    // ...
    require(bidAmount >= 1.startingBid, '...');
    // ...
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- add a check within the `_placeBid` function to ensure that the auction is active before accepting a bid. This can be done by using the `_isAuctionPeriod` function, 
```solidity
function _placeBid(...) internal {
    require(_isAuctionPeriod(tokenId), "Auction is not active");
    // ...
}
``` 
 
- In this way the contract can enforce the correct auction logic and prevent the risk of users losing funds by bidding outside the auction period.
