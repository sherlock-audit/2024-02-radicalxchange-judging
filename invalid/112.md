# Unbidded Auctions can not get closed because of not checking `repossessor` address.

## Summary
Because of not checking the `repossessor` address when initializing the collection, or setting it, the Auction will be Unclosable, and The token can get locked in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

If no one bids in the current round of the auction, the token is transferred to the `repossessor` address, but if this address can not receive the token, the auction can not be closed.

[auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L526-L530](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L526-L530)
```solidity
    function _closeAuction(uint256 tokenId) internal {
        ...

        if (l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound].bidder == address(0)) {
            // No bids were placed, transfer to repossessor
            Bid storage repossessorBid = l.bids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound][
                l.repossessor
            ];
            repossessorBid.bidAmount = 0;
            repossessorBid.feeAmount = 0;
            repossessorBid.collateralAmount = 0;
            repossessorBid.bidder = l.repossessor;

            // @audit set the Highest Bidder to `repossessor`, if no one Bids
<@          l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound] = repossessorBid;
        } else if (
            l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound].bidder != oldBidder
        ) { ... } else { ... }

        ...

        // Transfer to highest bidder
        IStewardLicense(address(this)).triggerTransfer(
            oldBidder,
<@          l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound].bidder,
            tokenId
        );

        ...
    }
```

This function either transfers the token or mints it if it does not exist.

[license/StewardLicenseInternal.sol#L96-L108](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/license/StewardLicenseInternal.sol#L96-L108)
```solidity
    function _triggerTransfer( ... ) internal {
        if (!_exists(tokenId)) {
            // Mint token
            _mint(to, tokenId);
        } else {
            _transfer(from, to, tokenId);
        }
    }
```

The problem is that if the receiver of the token is `address(0)`, mint/transfer the ERC721 token will revert.

When setting the `repossessor` address, the function does not check if the address provided is `address(0)` or not.

[auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L88-L92](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L88-L92)
```solidity
    // @audit Missing address(0) check
    function _setRepossessor(address repossessor) internal {
        EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout().repossessor = repossessor;

        emit RepossessorSet(repossessor);
    }
```
_Missing `address(0)` check is categorized as a `LOW` issue, But in this case, the Impact is `HIGH`. where this will lead to preventing the token from completing its Period Auction cycle, which is the desire of the protocol_.

And if the Collection is deployed without an owner, No one will be able to change the `repossessor` address.

## Impact
- Token getting locked in the Contract, if it was minted.
- The periodic Auction Cycle Mechanism will stop for that token, and there will no be any future Auction rounds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check that the provided address is not `address(0)`.
