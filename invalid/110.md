# Bidders can pay less fees than required because of rounding down

## Summary
Because of Rounding down fees calculations, when calculating the required fee amount, the value can be less than required by the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

When There is a new Bid, the protocol takes fees from the Bidder. But when calculating this fee, it is calculated by rounding down `feeNumerator` and `feeDenominator`.

[EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L594-L603](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L594-L603)
```solidity
    function _calculateFeeFromBid(uint256 bidAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 feeNumerator = IPeriodicPCOParamsReadable(address(this)).feeNumerator();
        uint256 feeDenominator = IPeriodicPCOParamsReadable(address(this)).feeDenominator();

        // @audit Rounding Down makes the value of fees decrease
        return (bidAmount * feeNumerator) / feeDenominator;
    }
```

### Example

- Let's say the fee is `10%` (feeNumerator = 1, feeDenominator = 10), with 4 Decimal Asset
- `bidAmount` = `99,999`
- `feeAmount = (bidAmount * feeNumerator) / feeDenominator` = $(99,999 * 1) / 10 = 9,999$
- `CollateralNeeded = bidAmount + feeAmount` = $9,999 + 99,999 = 109,998$
---
- As we can see the `collateralNeeded` decreased by 2 units when the `bidAmound` is `99,999`.
- If the `bidAmound` is `100,000` (greater than by just one unit, the `feeAmount` could be `10,000` and the `CollateralNeeded` would be `110,000`.
- `CollateralNeeeded` decreased by 2 units instead of 1 unit because of rounding down.

## Impact
Less fees collected by the protocol over time.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Always round in the favour of the protocol, not in the favour of the user, which is rounding Up instead of rounding Down.

You can use [OpenZeppelin mulDiv](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/math/Math.sol#L212-L214) function to multiply and then divide using Rounding Up.
