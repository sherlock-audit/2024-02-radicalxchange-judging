# Auction without repossessor can result in _closeAuction() revert

## Summary

The solution allows to initialise new auction by any user. Action instance can be created with `COMPONENT_ROLE` role assigned or without. The input parameters has no strict input validation. Thus, an user can initialise new auction without setting address for `repossessor` parameter. In such case, when no bids were placed for particular token Id, the `_closeAuction()` will revert in every case, as it attempts to mint/transfer ERC721-compliant `StewardLicense` token to `address(0)`, which is not allowed in OpenZepplin implementation.

## Vulnerability Detail

The solution allows to initialise new auction with or without owner set. If owner is provided, the `COMPONENT_ROLE` role is assigned to this address. User with this role assigned can update the `repossessor` with the `setRepossessor()` function. Additionally, the `repossessor` has no input validation in the `initialise()` functions. Thus, is possible to create new audit with `repossessor` set to `address(0)` and without possibility to update this parameter.

```solidity
    function initializeAuction(
        address repossessor_,
...
    ) external {
        require(
            !_isInitialized(),
            'EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet: already initialized'
        );

        _setSupportsInterface(type(IPeriodicAuctionReadable).interfaceId, true);
        _initializeAuction(
            repossessor_,
...
        );
    }

    /**
     * @notice Initialize auction parameters with owner
     */
    function initializeAuction(
        address owner_,
        address repossessor_,
...
    ) external {
        require(
            !_isInitialized(),
            'EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet: already initialized'
        );

        _setSupportsInterface(type(IPeriodicAuctionReadable).interfaceId, true);
        _setSupportsInterface(type(IPeriodicAuctionWritable).interfaceId, true);
        _grantRole(COMPONENT_ROLE, owner_);
        _initializeAuction(
            repossessor_,
...
        );
    }
```

```solidity
    function _initializeAuction(
        address repossessor,
...
    ) internal {
...
        _setRepossessor(repossessor);
...
    }
```

```solidity
    function _setRepossessor(address repossessor) internal {
        EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout().repossessor = repossessor;

        emit RepossessorSet(repossessor);
    }
```

```solidity
    function setRepossessor(
        address repossessor_
    ) external onlyRole(COMPONENT_ROLE) {
        _setRepossessor(repossessor_);
    }
```

When there is no bids and auction time is ended, every call to the `_closeAuction()` will revert, as the function attempts to mint/transfer NFT token to `address(0)`, which is by design disallowed in OpenZepplin implementation.

```solidity
    function _closeAuction(uint256 tokenId) internal {
...
        if (l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound].bidder == address(0)) {
            // No bids were placed, transfer to repossessor
            Bid storage repossessorBid = l.bids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound][
                l.repossessor
            ];
            repossessorBid.bidAmount = 0;
            repossessorBid.feeAmount = 0;
            repossessorBid.collateralAmount = 0;
            repossessorBid.bidder = l.repossessor;

            l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound] = repossessorBid;
        } else if (
...
        }
...
        // Transfer to highest bidder
        IStewardLicense(address(this)).triggerTransfer(
            oldBidder,
            l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound].bidder,
            tokenId
        );
...
    }
```

## Proof of concept

```typescript
    it('cannot close auction with no bids and repossesor set to address(0)', async function () {
      // Auction start: Now - 200
      // Auction end: Now + 100
      const instance = await getInstance({
        auctionLengthSeconds: 300,
        initialPeriodStartTime: (await time.latest()) - 200,
        licensePeriod: 1000,
        repossessor: ethers.constants.AddressZero
      });
      const licenseMock = await ethers.getContractAt(
        'NativeStewardLicenseMock',
        instance.address,
      );

      await time.increase(100);

      //@audit this call reverts
      await instance.connect(owner).closeAuction(0);
    });
```

## Impact

The invalid configuration can result in permanent lockout of NFT due to revert in `_closeAuction()` function when no bids were placed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to implement strict input validation that prevents auction creation with invalid configuration.
