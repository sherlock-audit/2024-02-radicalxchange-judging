# _placeBid reverts for perfectly fine bid and collateral amount.

## Summary
_placeBid reverts for perfectly fine bid and collateral amount.
## Vulnerability Detail
the function `_placeBid` is responsible for placing bids ,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L286-L291
```solidity=286
function _placeBid(
        uint256 tokenId,
        address bidder,
        uint256 bidAmount,
        uint256 collateralAmount
    ) internal
```
the fee amount is calculated as the difference between the `totalCollateralAmount` and `bidAmount`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L334
```solidity=334
feeAmount = totalCollateralAmount - bidAmount;
```
and the fee amount is checked to be the current fee percentage of bidAmount
```solidity=337
require(
            _checkBidAmount(bidAmount, feeAmount),
            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Incorrect bid amount'
        );
```
while `totalCollateralAmount` is the amount of collateral given for this token and this auction round, the `bidAmount` is only the currently given bid amount, meaning that the fee would be much larger than what it's supposed to be if a bidder bids twice in the same round. and the check will revert
**POC:**
- lets assume that the fees are set to 10%.
- Alice bids for token A in round 0 bid = 10 so it needs to give in collateral 11 (10 + 10/100*10)
- Alice gets outbid , then she wants to bid again now with bid 20 so it needs to give 22 as collateral to cover for fees.
-  _placeBid function execution will be as follow :
-  totalCollateralAmount = 11 + 22 = 33, bidAmount = 20
-  feeAmount = 33 - 20 = 13
-  the check `_checkBidAmount` will return false because the feeAmount should be 10% of 20 = 2 and not 13.
- meaning the function will revert while it shouldn't have
## Impact
the function `_placeBid` reverts when it shouldn't , negatively affecting users.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
instead of `feeAmount = totalCollateralAmount - bidAmount;` we should have:
```solidity
totalBidAmount = bidAmount + bid.bidAmount;
feeAmount = totalCollateralAmount - totalBidAmount;
```
