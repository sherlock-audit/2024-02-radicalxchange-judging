# risk of reentrancy in `_withdrawCollateral`

medium

## Summary
 `EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol`  has identified a concern regarding the implementation of the `_withdrawCollateral` function. The function employs a direct transfer of Ether to the bidder, which deviates from the recommended withdrawal pattern.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_withdrawCollateral` function is designed to send Ether directly to the address of a bidder, which is seen as a push-based approach to transferring funds. This pattern is less secure than a pull-based approach, where users initiate the withdrawal of their funds.

Although the `_withdrawCollateral` function is internal and cannot be directly exploited by an external call, if it is used in a public or external function without proper reentrancy guards, it could be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks due to the low-level call pattern used for transferring Ether.

## Impact
reentrancy attacks due to the low-level call pattern used for transferring Ether.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L439
```solidity
 /**
     * @notice Withdraw collateral
     */
    function _withdrawCollateral(address bidder) internal {
        EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout
            storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();

        uint256 collateralAmount = l.availableCollateral[bidder];

        require(
            collateralAmount > 0,
            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: No collateral to withdraw'
        );

        // Make collateral unavailable to withdraw
        l.availableCollateral[bidder] = 0;

        // Transfer collateral back to bidder
        //slither-disable-next-line low-level-calls
        (bool success, ) = bidder.call{ value: collateralAmount }('');
        require(
            success,
            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Failed to withdraw collateral'
        );
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- follow CEI patterns
- it is recommended to adopt the withdrawal pattern, this pattern involves two steps: first, the contract marks the funds as available for withdrawal, and second, the user calls a separate function to withdraw the funds.
