# InitializeAuction function susceptible to front running as it lacks access Control

## Summary
The `initializeAuction` function is vulnerable to front-running.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol lacks proper access control, allowing any user to call `initializeAuction`. An attacker can monitor the memory pool for contract creation and exploit this vulnerability by front-running the `initializeAuction` function before the protocol calls the `initializeAuction` function.

## Impact
If an attacker successfully frontruns and initializes the protocol with malicious parameters, it becomes impossible to reverse or amend.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement valid access control on the `InitializeAuction` function to ensure only the relevant `deployer` can initialize
