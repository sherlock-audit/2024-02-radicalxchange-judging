# Not implemented restriction inside `EnglishPeriodAuctionInternal::_cancelAllBids` leads to possibility of stealing funds by attacker

## Summary

Not implemented similar restriction like in [\_cancelBid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L378-L411) for [\_cancelAllBids](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L416-L434) can lead to stealing funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

[\_cancelAllBids](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L416-L434) like name suggest is cancelling every bid user made in current round. Functions is working as expected (it cancel bids), however it doesn't check - like [\_cancelBid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L378-L411) - if `msg.sender` is highest bidder in current round.

Malicious user - Bob - can use that to his advantage:

1. Firstly Bob needs to win his Steward License (SL).
2. Later, when another round is starting for SL - Bob from his second account (let's call Bob2) is putting as bidAmount absurdly high amount of ETH (in PoC I used 10 ETH). Basically the higher bid is, then Bob has higher chance of winning. Additionally he never lose money, because in worst case scenario, when Bob lost - he can [withdrawCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L439-L460)
3. After putting bid from Bob2, immidietaly he calls function [cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/facets/EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.sol#L187-L190) - thanks to that his ETH balance is the same as before putting bid (minus gas fees).
4. When auction closed, Bob receives for his `availableCollateral` balance the amount Bob2 put as a `bidAmount`.
5. Bob2 withdraws his collateral

When balance of auction smart contract is less then collateral of Bob2 - he won't be able to withdraw. However I think this scenario is highly improbable, because majority of people won't be likely to pay gas fees everytime after auction is closed. Especially in times of high gas fees.

## Impact

User can steal other people's funds from `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet` smart contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend adding the same check - `bidder != l.highestBids[tokenId][round].bidder` as in [\_cancelBid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L416-L434)
