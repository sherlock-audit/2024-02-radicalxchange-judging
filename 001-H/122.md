# a user can cancel his bid even if he is the highest biddeer and win without tranferring a bid

## Summary
the function **_cancelAllBids** misses a critical check which allows user to cancel even if they are the highest bidder  
## Vulnerability Detail

- the function **EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal._cancelBid** and **EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal._cancelAllBids** both are used to cancel a bid but the second one misses a check which prevent the highest bidder from canceling a bid   in the function **_cancelBId** 
 there is a code that prevent the highest bidder from withdrawing  ` require(
            bidder != l.highestBids[tokenId][round].bidder,
            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Cannot cancel bid if highest bidder'
        );`
but in there is no check in   **EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal._cancelAllBids** so by using this function a user can steal the bid by transferring   a big amount  and the call the  _cancelAllBids  function when the auction is  going to end  so when  calling _cancelAllBids  the  **l.highestBids** is not update only the collateral balance is updated so a user can win the auciton without transferring any amount  
## Impact
Dos user by transfering a big amount and canceling it when the auction is going to end
or win without a collateral
