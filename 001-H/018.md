# Flawed bid cancellation logic allows user to win auction with 100% certainty without even spending any money

## Summary
The logic to cancel all bids differs from cancelling individual bids which allows a user to bid max amount and guarantee auction win, while also refunding their bid
## Vulnerability Detail
If we try to cancel a bid while we are the highest bidder, the [following line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L393-L396) prohibits us from doing so:

```solidity
    require(
        bidder != l.highestBids[tokenId][round].bidder,
        'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Cannot cancel bid if highest bidder'
    );
```

The issue is that the same line is missing in the function to [cancel all bids](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L416-L434), while it also includes and cancels the bid for the current round in the for-loop:

```solidity
    for (uint256 i = 0; i <= currentAuctionRound; i++) { // @audit i <= currentAuctionRound instead of <
```

The cancel all bids function changes the bid in storage, but does not adjust the highest bid in storage.

This allows for the following scenario:

1. User bids `type(uint256).max` on an auction
2. User calls `_cancelAllBids()`
3. His bid is cancelled and added back to the `l.availableCollateral[bidder]`
4. The highest bid in storage remains untouched (bid is `type(uint256).max`)
5. User withdraws collateral

Now no one can out-bid the user since they cannot bid more than the max value for the uint, the auction concludes and the user wins it while also having already withdrawn his bid/collateral.
## Impact
User can bid max uint value, wins auction with 100% certainty AND doesn't even spend anything since he withdrew his collateral. Free auction win, 100% certainty. Logic is completely flawed.

## Recommendation
Either change for-loop to `<` instead of `<=` or make sure user is not highest bidder like in singular cancels.
