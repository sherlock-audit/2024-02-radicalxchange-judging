# malicious user can steal his collateral back after he wins the auction

## Summary
In current implementation, a bidder can cancel and withdraw his collateral if he is not the highest bidder. And if the user is the highest bidder, his collateral can't be withdrawn and will be transferred to privious owner when `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.closeAuction` is called.
In `EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal._cancelBid`, there is a check to make sure the `bidder` isn't the highest bidder. But in `EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal._cancelAllBids`, the function lacks of such check, without the check, a malicious user can steal his collateral after he wins the auction.

## Vulnerability Detail
In [EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal._cancelBid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L378-L411), there is a check to make sure the bidder is not the highest bidder in the aution in [EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L393-L396](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L393-L396)

But in [EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal._cancelAllBids](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L416-L434), the function lacks of such check.
```solidity
416     function _cancelAllBids(uint256 tokenId, address bidder) internal {
417         EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout
418             storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();
419
420         uint256 currentAuctionRound = l.currentAuctionRound[tokenId];
421
422         for (uint256 i = 0; i <= currentAuctionRound; i++) {
423             Bid storage bid = l.bids[tokenId][i][bidder]; /// <<<--- function doesn't check if the bidder is the highest bidder here.
424
425             if (bid.collateralAmount > 0) {
426                 // Make collateral available to withdraw
427                 l.availableCollateral[bidder] += bid.collateralAmount;
428
429                 // Reset collateral and bid
430                 bid.collateralAmount = 0;
431                 bid.bidAmount = 0;
432             }
433         }
434     }
```

attack step:
1. Alice(the malicious user) calls `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.placeBid` with enough large amount of collateral to win the auction
1. When the auction ends, Alice calls `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral` immediately after the auction ends, before `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.closeAuction` is called.

## Impact
Without the check, malicious user can steal his collateral back after he wins the auction
