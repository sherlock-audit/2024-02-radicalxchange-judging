# Users may not be able to claim their own amounts

## Summary

When the user fails to bid, he can claim the previous collateral through `cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral`, but if he participates too many times, the gas may exceed the block limit.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function for users to receive collateral is implemented as follows:

```solidity
    function cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral(uint256 tokenId) external {
        _cancelAllBids(tokenId, msg.sender);
        _withdrawCollateral(msg.sender);
    }
```

Cancellation of all bids and collection are implemented in the same function.

Both functions check one by one starting from the first auction, so if too many rounds are passed, the gas limit will be exceeded.

```solidity
    function _cancelAllBids(uint256 tokenId, address bidder) internal { 
        EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout
            storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();

        uint256 currentAuctionRound = l.currentAuctionRound[tokenId];

        for (uint256 i = 0; i <= currentAuctionRound; i++) { 
            Bid storage bid = l.bids[tokenId][i][bidder];

            if (bid.collateralAmount > 0) {
                // Make collateral available to withdraw
                l.availableCollateral[bidder] += bid.collateralAmount;

                // Reset collateral and bid
                bid.collateralAmount = 0;
                bid.bidAmount = 0;
            }
        }
    }
```



## Impact

Users may not be able to claim all of their collateral
