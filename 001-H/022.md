# Highest bidder can cancel bid through `_cancelAllBids`

## Summary 
`_cancelAllBids` allows highest bidder to cancel their bid

## Vulnerability Detail
In `EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal._cancelBid` prevents highest bidder from cancelling their bid [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L393-L396)

However, `EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal._cancelAllBids` employs custom logic and iterates through all rounds up to AND INCLUDING (due to <=) currentAuctionRound

Highest bidder can withdraw their collateral and remain the highestBidder for the current round, winning the auction. 
## Impact
Loss of funds / Broken core functionality 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
        require(
            bidder != l.highestBids[tokenId][round].bidder,
            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Cannot cancel bid if highest bidder')
```
...
```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i <= currentAuctionRound; i++) { // allows i = currentAuctionRound
            Bid storage bid = l.bids[tokenId][i][bidder];

            if (bid.collateralAmount > 0) {
                // Make collateral available to withdraw
                l.availableCollateral[bidder] += bid.collateralAmount;

                // Reset collateral and bid
                bid.collateralAmount = 0;
                bid.bidAmount = 0;
            }
        }
```

## Recommendation
Change the operator in `_cancelAllBids` to i < currentAuctionRound
