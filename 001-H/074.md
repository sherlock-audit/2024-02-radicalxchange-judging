# Highest bidder can cancel bid and win auction for free

## Summary
There are two functions that can be used to cancel a bid: `_cancelBid()` and `_cancelAllBids()`

## Vulnerability Detail
`_cancelBid` has a check that doesn't allow the highest bidder to cancel his bid:

```solidity
require(
    bidder != l.highestBids[tokenId][round].bidder,
    'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Cannot cancel bid if highest bidder'
);
```
However `_cancelAllBids()` doesn't have this check anywhere and it cancels all bids up to the current round (including it) for a specified bidder.

This means that the highest bidder can use `cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral()` from the facet and cancel his bid which shouldn't be possible according to the documentation:

"Only bids that are no longer the highest bid can be canceled and their associated collateral withdrawn"

## Impact
If the highest bidder cancels his bid he can still win the auction but he would have withdrawn all of his collateral which basically means he won the auction for free.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the require check from `_cancelBid()` to `cancelAllBids()` in the loop or perhaps change the loop to itterate only to 
`< currentAuctionRound` instead of `<= currentAuctionRound`
