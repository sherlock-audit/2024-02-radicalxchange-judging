# _cancelAllBids does not check if the current bidder is the highest bid bidder

## Summary

The function _cancelAllBids does not check if the current bidder is the highest bid bidder. A malicious user can place a very high bid and then withdraw their collateral. This leads to various problems.

## Vulnerability Detail

1) Other users will be demotivated to bid further.
2) If this bid remains the highest bid at the end of the period and there is enough collateral deposited by other users, the malicious user can successfully complete the purchase at the expense of other users.
3) If there is not enough collateral from other users and fees are set, _closeAuction will revert every time, which means a permanent Dos on the contract.
4) If there is not enough collateral from other users and no fees are set, the malicious user will successfully win the auction.
