# The highest bidder can cancel all of his bids and claim the Steward License for free

## Summary

The vulnerability allows the highest bidder to cancel all their bids, and claim the Steward License without any cost.

## Vulnerability Detail


The `cancelBid(...)` function in `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet` allows bidders who didn't win a round to retrieve their deposited collateral by canceling their bids. However, there's a catch: this feature only works for rounds where the bidder wasn't the highest bidder.  It prevents the winning bidder from canceling their bid and withdrawing their collateral. Doing so safeguards against potential disruption in the allocation of funds, ensuring that funds remain available for payments to the previous steward and creator circle when the round is closed.

```solidity
File: EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol

function _cancelBid(
        uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 round,
        address bidder
    ) internal {
        EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout
            storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();

        address currentBidder;
        if (IStewardLicense(address(this)).exists(tokenId)) {
            currentBidder = IStewardLicense(address(this)).ownerOf(tokenId);
        } else {
            currentBidder = l.initialBidder;
        }

        require(
@>            bidder != l.highestBids[tokenId][round].bidder,
            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Cannot cancel bid if highest bidder'
        );

        Bid storage bid = l.bids[tokenId][round][bidder];

        require(
            bid.collateralAmount > 0,
            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: No bid to cancel'
        );

        // Make collateral available to withdraw
        l.availableCollateral[bidder] += bid.collateralAmount;

        // Reset collateral and bid
        bid.collateralAmount = 0;
        bid.bidAmount = 0;
    }
```

But the same conditions is not present is `EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal::_cancelAllBids(...)` when calling `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet::cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral(...)`. That means a bid can be cancelled for the round in which the bidder is the highest bidder.

```solidity
File: EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol

    function _cancelAllBids(uint256 tokenId, address bidder) internal {
        EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout
            storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();


        uint256 currentAuctionRound = l.currentAuctionRound[tokenId];


        for (uint256 i = 0; i <= currentAuctionRound; i++) {
            Bid storage bid = l.bids[tokenId][i][bidder];


            if (bid.collateralAmount > 0) {
                // Make collateral available to withdraw
                l.availableCollateral[bidder] += bid.collateralAmount;


                // Reset collateral and bid
                bid.collateralAmount = 0;
                bid.bidAmount = 0;
            }
        }
    }
```

Here's how a bidder can manipulate the auction process:

1. **Bob, the Bidder**: Bob participates in the auction by placing bids until he becomes the highest bidder in a round.
2. Then at the end of the round, he calls `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet::cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral(...)` and cancels all his bids for all rounds including the current round. If the `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet::closeAuction(...)` is made before that, he can just frontrun that transaction.
3. Because of cancel call, all of his collateral has been added in `availableCollateral` mapping for him to claim. And the same will be withdrawn at the same time.
4. Also, auction has ended so no other bidder can bid now. So Bob is still the highest bidder.
5. Now call to `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet::closeAuction(...)` is made to close the auction for current round. The functions transfers the steward NFT to Bob and transfer the fee Amount to the creator circle. Note that the call to `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet::closeAuction(...)` will be successful only if there are enough funds in the contract. If all of the bidders who placed their bid in the round and has claimed their collateral by cancelling their bids, then the function will cause DoS as their will be not enough amounts to claim. If call is successful, Bob has won the Steward License NFT and he has didn't pay anything for it.
6. The `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet::closeAuction(...)` function also adds the bid amount in `availableCollateral` of the old bidder for him to claim later. When he tries to do that if there are enough funds in the contract, he will be able to claim the collateral but other bidders will be in loss. Otherwise the withdraw collateral function will cause DoS.

## Impact

The highest bidder can claim the Steward License for free, bypassing the intended auction process.

## Recommendation

It is recommended to add the following changes:

```diff
    function _cancelAllBids(uint256 tokenId, address bidder) internal {
        EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout
            storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();


        uint256 currentAuctionRound = l.currentAuctionRound[tokenId];


        for (uint256 i = 0; i <= currentAuctionRound; i++) {
            Bid storage bid = l.bids[tokenId][i][bidder];

-             if (bid.collateralAmount > 0){
+            if (bid.collateralAmount > 0 && bidder != l.highestBids[tokenId][i].bidder) {
                // Make collateral available to withdraw
                l.availableCollateral[bidder] += bid.collateralAmount;


                // Reset collateral and bid
                bid.collateralAmount = 0;
                bid.bidAmount = 0;
            }
        }
    }
```
