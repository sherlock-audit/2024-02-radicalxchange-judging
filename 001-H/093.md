# Bid Cancellation Logic flaw

medium

## Summary
The `_cancelBid` function of the `EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol`  allows users to cancel their bids, but there is a lack of necessary checks to ensure that the auction is active and the bid is valid for cancellation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_cancelBid` function permits bidders to retract their bids and recover their collateral. 
However, the function does not  validate whether the auction is ongoing or if the bid meets certain criteria that should prevent its cancellation (e.g., being the current highest bid).
```solidity
/**
     * @notice Cancel bid for current round if not highest bidder
     */
    function _cancelBid(
        uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 round,
        address bidder
    ) internal {
        EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout
            storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();

        address currentBidder;
        if (IStewardLicense(address(this)).exists(tokenId)) {
            currentBidder = IStewardLicense(address(this)).ownerOf(tokenId);
        } else {
            currentBidder = l.initialBidder;
        }
// @audit 
        require(
            bidder != l.highestBids[tokenId][round].bidder,
            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Cannot cancel bid if highest bidder'
// @audit // Missing checks for auction active state and bid validity
        );

        Bid storage bid = l.bids[tokenId][round][bidder];

        require(
            bid.collateralAmount > 0,
            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: No bid to cancel'
        );

        // Make collateral available to withdraw
        l.availableCollateral[bidder] += bid.collateralAmount;

        // Reset collateral and bid
        bid.collateralAmount = 0;
        bid.bidAmount = 0;
    }
```

## Impact
Bidders can cancel bids at any time, including during an active auction or when they are the highest bidder, it  undermine the integrity of the auction process. 
This lead to a situation where the highest bidder retracts their bid without consequence, potentially causing confusion and a loss of trust in the auction mechanism.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, it is recommended to add checks within the `_cancelBid` function to ensure that the auction is active and the bid is not the current highest bid before allowing cancellation. This can be done by using the `_isAuctionPeriod` function and comparing the bid to be cancelled with the current highest bid:

```solidity
function _cancelBid(uint256 tokenId, uint256 round, address bidder) internal {
    require(_isAuctionPeriod(tokenId), "Auction must be active to cancel a bid");
    require(bidder != 1.highestBids[tokenId][round].bidder, "Cannot cancel bid if highest bidder");
    // ...
}
```
