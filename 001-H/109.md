# `EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal::_cancelAllBids()` will be un-callable after many rounds

## Summary
`EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal::_cancelAllBids`, loops through all rounds from 0 to the current round, making it run OOG if there are so many rounds. 

## Vulnerability Detail
NFT token is auctioned in periods (rounds), where after the first period finished, `licensePeriod` passed. The item will be available for being Auctioned again. and so on.

Since the rounds will be continuous (unstoppable), it can be up to 100 rounds, 1000 rounds, or even more. it does not have a stop limit.

For Bidders to cancel their bids from more than one period, they need to call `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet::cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral()`, where this function will first fire `EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal::_cancelAllBids()` to cancel all bidder bids from different periods, then call  `EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal::_withdrawCollateral()` to withdraw user collateral (ETH).

But as `EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal::_cancelAllBids()` loops from 0 to the current round. This will make it uncallable after many rounds pass as it will run `OOG`.

```solidity
    function _cancelAllBids(uint256 tokenId, address bidder) internal {
        EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();

        uint256 currentAuctionRound = l.currentAuctionRound[tokenId];

        // @audit start from 0 to the currentAuctionRound
        for (uint256 i = 0; i <= currentAuctionRound; i++) {
            Bid storage bid = l.bids[tokenId][i][bidder];

            if (bid.collateralAmount > 0) { ... }
        }
    }
```


## Impact
Bidders will not be able to cancel all their collaterals then withdraw it at a single execution using `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet::cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral()`

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Let the function accept the Starting round instead of starting from 0.

So We are in Round `11,000`, and the Bidder has only collaterals from `10,500` to this round he can pass the starting round as `10,500` to let the loop starts from it.
