# The winning bidder can close all bids and still win the token without paying anything. Furthermore, a very high bid will cause monetary loss to other bidders as they will need to cover the bidding fee.

## Summary
The `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.sol` contract provides a method for the bidders to cancel all of their bids via the `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet::cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral()` function. If the bidder is the winning bidder, then all of their bid amounts are reset to 0, and there is no checks performed to ensure that the bidder is not a winning bidder, and the `highestBids` storage state is not updated to reflect this.

This causes the close auction method to still consider the bidder that has withdrawn all the bids as the bid winner, and the bidder gets the token without paying for the bid. When the token is transferred, it pulls the funds from other bidders to cover for the fee amount, thereby creating monetary loss for other bidders too.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet::cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral()` allows the bidders to cancel all of their bids, and get their collateral.

This internally calls `EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal::_cancelBid` function which sets all the bids of the bidder for all the rounds to 0:

```solidity=
function _cancelAllBids(uint256 tokenId, address bidder) internal {
    EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();

    uint256 currentAuctionRound = l.currentAuctionRound[tokenId];

    for (uint256 i = 0; i <= currentAuctionRound; i++) {
        Bid storage bid = l.bids[tokenId][i][bidder];

        if (bid.collateralAmount > 0) {
            // Make collateral available to withdraw
            l.availableCollateral[bidder] += bid.collateralAmount;

            // Reset collateral and bid
            bid.collateralAmount = 0;
            bid.bidAmount = 0;
        }
    }
}
```

Furthermore, the `EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal::_withdrawCollateral()` function is called which withdraws all the available collateral from the canceled bids back to the bidder:

```solidity
function _withdrawCollateral(address bidder) internal {
    EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();

    uint256 collateralAmount = l.availableCollateral[bidder];

    require(collateralAmount > 0, "EnglishPeriodicAuction: No collateral to withdraw");

    // Make collateral unavailable to withdraw
    l.availableCollateral[bidder] = 0;

    // Transfer collateral back to bidder
    //slither-disable-next-line low-level-calls
    (bool success,) = bidder.call{value: collateralAmount}("");
    require(success, "EnglishPeriodicAuction: Failed to withdraw collateral");
}
```

Therefore, after calling `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet::cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral()`, the bids are reset to 0, and any funds that were sent by the bidder to the contract gets transferred back to the bidder.

Now, once the auction is over, the `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet::closeAuction()` is called. This function still determines that the bidder who withdrew all of their bids is still the bid winner because the `highestBids` storage state variable retains the bidder as the bid winner.

## Impact

When the bidder calls `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet::cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral()`, they get to cancel all of their bids, and get their collateral back. But the system still treats this bidder as the bid winner, and upon closing the auction, this bidder wins the bid on the token without paying anything for the bid amount.

Furthermore, when close auction is called, the fee is transferred to the beneficiary, which is taken from the contract balance. Because the bidder already pulled all of their funds back, this fee amount gets covered from the contract's balance which actually belongs to other bidders that did not win the auctions. The attacking bidder can put a large big such that the fee is very high, which will cause monetary loss to the other bidders.

In summary, there are two primary impacts:
* The attacker bidder gets the token without paying for the token
* The attacker bidder can post a very large bid, and then cancel all the bids. This will cause other bidders fund's to be used to cover the fee for the large bid that was placed by the attacker bid.
    * If there are no other bidders for the round, then the auction cannot be closed, as not enough funds will be available to transfer the fee to the beneficiary. This will then require sending of some funds to the contract, and then calling the close auction function, otherwise the auction will remain stuck.

## Code Snippet
Place the below code in `test/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuction.ts`, and run using `yarn run hardhat test`:

```javascript

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

* Similar to `EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal::_cancelBid()`, ensure that the caller does not have the highest bid for the current round of the ongoing auction.
* Or, skip the current auction rounds of the tokens in the `EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal::_cancelAllBids()` function.
