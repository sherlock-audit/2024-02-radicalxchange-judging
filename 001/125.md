# Existing owner of token or initial bidder can not place bid

## Summary
Existing owner of token or initial bidder can not place bid.

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol , Here in function [_placeBid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L319-L340)
In the below code If bidder is currentBidder then feeAmount will be equal to total Collateral Amount.
`if (bidder == currentBidder) {`
            `// If current bidder, collateral is entire fee amount`
            `feeAmount = totalCollateralAmount;`
        `}`

but here In the below code this check ensure that the calculated fee amount (which is calculated based on given `bidAmount`) is equal to the given 'feeAmount'.  i.e `calculatedFeeAmount == feeAmount`.
`require(`
            `_checkBidAmount(bidAmount, feeAmount),`
            `'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Incorrect bid amount'`
        `);`
        
Below is function _checkBidAmount.
`function _checkBidAmount(`
        `uint256 bidAmount,`
        `uint256 feeAmount`
    `) internal view returns (bool) {`
        `uint256 calculatedFeeAmount = _calculateFeeFromBid(bidAmount);`
        `return calculatedFeeAmount == feeAmount;`
    `}`

and This is the code for calculation of fee from `bidAmount`
`function _calculateFeeFromBid(`
        `uint256 bidAmount`
    `) internal view returns (uint256) {`
        `uint256 feeNumerator = IPeriodicPCOParamsReadable(address(this))`
            `.feeNumerator();`
        `uint256 feeDenominator = IPeriodicPCOParamsReadable(address(this))`
            `.feeDenominator();`
     `return (bidAmount * feeNumerator) / feeDenominator;`
    `}`

As In this case when bidder is currentBidder `feeAmount = totalCollateralAmount` which would be higher than the calculatedFeeAmount so this check ``require(`
            `_checkBidAmount(bidAmount, feeAmount),`
            `'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Incorrect bid amount'`
        `);`` will always revert and bid will not be placed.
## Impact
If owner of token or initial bidder want to place bid in auction to reclaim the token then bid will not be placed.

## Recommendation
Apply this check _checkBidAmount() only for bidders who are not currentBidder.
