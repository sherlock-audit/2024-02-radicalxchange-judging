# Users can cancel their own highest bid of any round, including the current one

## Summary
The highest bid of a round can be canceled by the bidder.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function [cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/facets/EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.sol#L187) allows to cancel the highest bid of any round, including the current one.

The whole system works on the assumption that the highest bid cannot be canceled. This can cause all sorts of issues including DOS or funds theft. As an example, if an attacker is the current higher bidder of an auction that can be closed he can:
1. Cancel his own highest bid via [cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/facets/EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.sol#L187), which will add the bidded amount to his `availableCollateral` and then withdraw it immediately.
2. Close the auction via [closeAuction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/facets/EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.sol#L225), which will transfer the NFT to him.
3. Attacker won the auction, got the NFT and recovered his bid.

## Impact
Theft of funds, winning an auction without bidding anything.

## Recommendation
In [cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/facets/EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.sol#L187) don't allow a bid to be canceled if it's the highest one. Don't revert but skip it with a `continue` inside the for loop.
