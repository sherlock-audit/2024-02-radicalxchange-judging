# Highest bidder can cancel his bid even though he's not supposed to

## Summary
Highest bidder shouldn't be able to cancel his bid. This is can be seen by this require statement in the `_cancelBid` function in EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal:
```solidity
function _cancelBid() {
        require(
            bidder != l.highestBids[tokenId][round].bidder,
            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Cannot cancel bid if highest bidder'
        );
}
```
The problem is that this can be circumvented by using the `_cancelAllBids` since this function doesn't have the same require statement. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The highest bidder can still cancel his bid even though he's not supposed to be able to do that. 
## Impact
This will lead to the to 2nd highest bidder winning the auction even though he didn't expect this. This behavior bypasses protocol's intended behavior.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check in `_cancelAllBids` that checks if it's current round and the bidder is the highest bidder, he should not be able to cancel the bid.
