# `_cancelAllBids` allows to cancel the highest bid; can be exploited to steal all contract funds

## Summary

[EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal._cancelAllBids()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L416) allows to cancel all bids, including the highest one. As a result, the highest bidder can withdraw all collateral, but the the now uncollaterized (and arbitrary high) highest bid, upon closing the auction, will be added to the available collateral of the old bidder, and can be withdrawn, thus allowing to drain all contract funds in one go.

## Vulnerability Detail

[_cancelAllBids](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L416-L434) doesn't include the check like [the check in _cancelBid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L393-L396) 

```solidity
require(
    bidder != l.highestBids[tokenId][round].bidder,
    'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Cannot cancel bid if highest bidder'
);
```

As a result, all bids of a bidder can be canceled, but the `highestBids[tokenId][round]` stays unchanged. This is critical, because when the auction is closed in [_closeAuction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L465), the value of the highest bid is [added to the available collateral of the old bidder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L499-L506). The available collateral can be then withdrawn in the next step in the standard manner via `withdrawCollateral`. 

The above sequence can be employed to completely drain all contract in one go via first creating the highest bid with the amount equal to all contract funds, canceling it, and withdrawing the collateral back (can be also easily done in a single transaction via a flash loan); all contract funds will then be transferred to the old bidder when the auction is closed.

## Impact

All contract funds can be stolen due to the missing check of canceling the highest bid.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend to supplement `_cancelAllBids` with the check disallowing to cancel the highest bid, e.g. as follows:
