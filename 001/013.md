# Highest bidder can cancel his bid and close the auction to win the auction.

## Summary
The `_cancelAllBids()` function doesn't check for the highest bidder and so he can cancel all of his bids and can trick the auction at last moment.
## Vulnerability Detail
The bidder if not a highest bidder can cancel his bids and can make the collateral available to withdraw by calling [`_cancelBid()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L378C14-L411) however same is not true for the [ `_cancelAllBids()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L416-L434), Even the highest bidder can cancel all of his previous bids and make his collateral withdrawable due to the lack of the `require check` just like it is done in [`_cancelBid()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L393-L396)

```solidity
 require(
            bidder != l.highestBids[tokenId][round].bidder,
            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Cannot cancel bid if highest bidder'
        );
```

Anyone can game the auction by just placing an incredibly large amount for bid in the end and then call     [ `_cancelAllBids()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L416-L434)   which updates the [`availableCollateral Mapping`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L427)  to withdrawable collateral and then the highest bidder can just withdraw his collateral and call the `_closeAuction()`/[cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/facets/EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.sol#L187-L190) since it is callable by anyone as mentioned in the docs.
## Impact
A malicious bidder can gain the stewardship without putting in any collateral in the auction.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
   function _cancelAllBids(uint256 tokenId, address bidder) internal {
        EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout
            storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();

        uint256 currentAuctionRound = l.currentAuctionRound[tokenId];

        for (uint256 i = 0; i <= currentAuctionRound; i++) {
            Bid storage bid = l.bids[tokenId][i][bidder];

            if (bid.collateralAmount > 0) {
                // Make collateral available to withdraw
                l.availableCollateral[bidder] += bid.collateralAmount;

                // Reset collateral and bid
                bid.collateralAmount = 0;
                bid.bidAmount = 0;
            }
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check in `_cancelAllBids()` function  just like done in `_cancelBid()` function for the highest bidder not being able to cancel his bids.

```diff solidity
    function _cancelAllBids(uint256 tokenId, address bidder) internal {
        EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout
            storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();

        uint256 currentAuctionRound = l.currentAuctionRound[tokenId];
+         require(
+           bidder != l.highestBids[tokenId][round].bidder,
+            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Cannot cancel bid if highest bidder'
+      );
        for (uint256 i = 0; i <= currentAuctionRound; i++) {
            Bid storage bid = l.bids[tokenId][i][bidder];

            if (bid.collateralAmount > 0) {
                // Make collateral available to withdraw
                l.availableCollateral[bidder] += bid.collateralAmount;

                // Reset collateral and bid
                bid.collateralAmount = 0;
                bid.bidAmount = 0;
            }
        }
    }
