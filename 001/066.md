# Function `_cancelAllBids()` does not check if the bid being cancelled is the highest bid

## Summary
`EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal._cancelAllBids()` does not check if the bid being cancelled is the highest bid. This vulnerability can be exploited by malicious bidders to manipulate auctions, potentially winning without paying. Consequently, some users may face difficulties withdrawing their collateral or ending auctions.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the function `EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal._cancelAllBids()`, there's no validation  if the bid being cancelled is not the highest bid. See the code snippet below:

```solidity
    function _cancelAllBids(uint256 tokenId, address bidder) internal {
        EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout
            storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();


        uint256 currentAuctionRound = l.currentAuctionRound[tokenId];


        for (uint256 i = 0; i <= currentAuctionRound; i++) {
            Bid storage bid = l.bids[tokenId][i][bidder];


            if (bid.collateralAmount > 0) {
                // Make collateral available to withdraw
                l.availableCollateral[bidder] += bid.collateralAmount;


                // Reset collateral and bid
                bid.collateralAmount = 0;
                bid.bidAmount = 0;
            }
        }
    }
```

As a result, if the current highest bidder calls `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral()`, their bid gets cancelled, releasing their collateral for withdrawal (`l.availableCollateral[bidder] += bid.collateralAmount;`). However, the record of the highest bid remains unchanged (`l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound]`). Consequently, when the auction concludes, this bidder obtains the auctioned token without paying for his bid.

Malicious bidders can exploit this by bidding high enough so no one will be able to outbid and then frontrun any call to `closeAuction()` by calling `cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral()`. Thus his bid will be cancelled, allowing his collateral to be withdraw and receiving the auctioned token. 

Consider a hypothetical auction with a 10% fee and the following bids:
1. Alice bids 100 ETH (Collateral: 110 ETH)
2. Bob bids 110 ETH (Collateral: 121 ETH)
3. Charlie bids 120 ETH (Collateral: 132 ETH)
4. Eve bids 200 ETH (Collateral: 220 ETH)
Total funds deposited into the auction contract: 583 ETH

Suppose no further bids are made, and before auction is closed, Eve executes `cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral()`, leaving the contract balance at 363 ETH. Now, let's analyze the contract's liabilities:

- 363 ETH from cancellable bids (110 + 121+ 132)
- 200 ETH payment to the previous token owner
- 20 ETH in fees

The total liabilities amount to 583 ETH, surpassing the contract balance. This situation leads to two potential outcomes:

- If all users manage to cancel their bids before the auction ends, the contract balance reaches zero by the time `closeAuction()` is called. Consequently, subsequent calls to `closeAuction()` will revert, causing a DoS.
- If `closeAuction()` is invoked before all users withdraw their collateral, insufficient funds remain to compensate all cancelled bids. Consequently, some users may be unable to retrieve their available collateral.

See the POC code below for the first scenario above (albeit with just one bidder). Apply the git diff below and run `yarn run hardhat test --grep POC`.

## Impact
Malicious bidders are able to win the auction without having to pay any funds. Furthermore, it jeopardizes the financial integrity of the auction contract, potentially resulting in failed auction closures or users unable to retrieve their funds.
