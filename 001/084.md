# Highest bidder can still cancel bid with cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral()

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L378-L434
According to the dev comments on the cancelBid function, the highest bidder is not allowed to cancel their bid.  Although this is adequately implemented in the internal _cancelBid function. It however can by bypassed when the highest bidder calls the cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral() which fails to check if the msg.sender is the highest bidder

## Vulnerability Detail
In the EnglishPeriodicAunctionFacet.sol, three functions can be used to cancel a bid which are the cancelBid(), thecancelBidAndWithdrawCollateral() and cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral(). The vulnerability lies in the cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral() which further calls  an internal _cancelAllBids(). Unlike the internal _cancelBid  function which adequately checks if msg.sender is an highest bidder, the internal function  _cancelAllBids() executed by the cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral() fails to check if msg.sender is the highest bidder allowing them to cancel bit and withdraw collateral
## Impact
The protocol fails in its expected sequence,
Highest bidder cancel bids during an aunction and withdraw collateral.
## Code Snippet
1. The internal _cancel() bid which correctly assess if the bidder is highest bidder
```solidity
    * @notice Cancel bid for current round if not highest bidder
     */
    function _cancelBid(
        uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 round,
        address bidder
    ) internal {
        EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout
            storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();

        address currentBidder;
        if (IStewardLicense(address(this)).exists(tokenId)) {
            currentBidder = IStewardLicense(address(this)).ownerOf(tokenId);
        } else {
            currentBidder = l.initialBidder;
        }

        require(
            bidder != l.highestBids[tokenId][round].bidder,
            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Cannot cancel bid if highest bidder'
        );
        ```
```solidity
```
2. This however calls an internal _cancelAllBids function which fails to check if the bidder is the highest bidder.
```solidity
 function cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral(uint256 tokenId) external {
        _cancelAllBids(tokenId, msg.sender);
        _withdrawCollateral(msg.sender);
    }
    ```
```solidity
```
3. This is the internal _cancelAllBids() that fails to veto if bidder is highest bidder
```solidity
function _cancelAllBids(uint256 tokenId, address bidder) internal {
        EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout
            storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();

        uint256 currentAuctionRound = l.currentAuctionRound[tokenId];

        for (uint256 i = 0; i <= currentAuctionRound; i++) {
            Bid storage bid = l.bids[tokenId][i][bidder];

            if (bid.collateralAmount > 0) {
                // Make collateral available to withdraw
                l.availableCollateral[bidder] += bid.collateralAmount;

                // Reset collateral and bid
                bid.collateralAmount = 0;
                bid.bidAmount = 0;
            }
        }
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Require statement to check if bidder is highest bidder should be added to the _cancelAllBids() function too
```solidity
require(
            bidder != l.highestBids[tokenId][round].bidder,
            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Cannot cancel bid if highest bidder'
        );
```
