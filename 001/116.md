## Summary
a  user cant bid twice on a single round due to a calculation error in the function **EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet._placebid**  is 
## Vulnerability Detail
In the function **EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet._placebid**  the fee amount is calculated   by subtracting **totalCollateralAmount - bidAmount**   but the thing  this equation only work when bidding for the first time because if we are bedding for  a second time ` totalCollateralAmount - bidAmount   ` will give us our previous  **bid.collateralAmount  +  our current fee** so   the require fucntion will revert `require(
            _checkBidAmount(bidAmount, feeAmount),
            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Incorrect bid amount'
        );`
## Impact
a user can't place bid twice
