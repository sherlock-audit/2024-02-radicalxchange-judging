# No Fees state makes the Auction process insolvable

## Summary
If the Collection Admin sets no fees, the auction process will break

## Vulnerability Detail

The Collection Admin (Artist) can set fees to get collected after the finalization of the auction. The fees are set by using [`feeDenominator`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/pco/facets/PeriodicPCOParamsFacet.sol#L124-L128) and [`feeNumerator`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/pco/facets/PeriodicPCOParamsFacet.sol#L108-L112).

If the Artist wants to set fees to zero, he can set the `feeNumerator` to zero, to make the fees `0%`.

The problem is that the Auction Contract does not take `zero fees state` in consideration. Where it forces a check that the `collateralAmount` should be greater than the `bidAmount`.

[auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L329-L332](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L329-L332)
```solidity
    function _placeBid( ... ) internal {
        ...

        if (bidder == currentBidder) {
            // If current bidder, collateral is entire fee amount
            feeAmount = totalCollateralAmount;
        } else {
            // @audit totalCollateralAmount equals bidAmount in zero fees state, the tx will revert in this case
            require(
❌️              totalCollateralAmount > bidAmount,
                'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Collateral must be greater than current bid'
            );
            // If new bidder, collateral is bidAmount + fee
            feeAmount = totalCollateralAmount - bidAmount;
        }

        // @audit check that the bidAmound to fees is correct 
        require(
            _checkBidAmount(bidAmount, feeAmount),
            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Incorrect bid amount'
        );
        
        ...
    }

```

This is the case if there is fees taken from the bid, but in case of zero fees this is not the case, as the `collateralAmount` will equal the `bidAmount`.

The bidder can not increase the bid by `1 wei` to just pass the check, as if he did that, the feeAmount will equal 1, and the transaction will revert in `_checkBidAmount()`, as the `feeAmount` should be zero.

This will make All Bidding processes in a DoS, if the Collection Admin (Artist) made fees equal to zero.

The issue could be more serious, where if the Collection Admin (Artist) chooses to make his NFT Collection Fully decentralized By initializing the Auction without `Auction Pitch Admin` role (this is normal behavior and allowed), he will not be able to change the fees again.

## Impact
The Artist who wants to make their NFT collections with zero fees will make their auction process break and insolvable.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the Condition by making it `>=` rather than `>` to accept the zero fees state.
