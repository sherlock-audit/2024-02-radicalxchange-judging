# The _cancelAllBids function has a vulnerability, as it does not verify whether the user at this time is the highest bidder

## Summary

The `_cancelAllBids` function has a vulnerability, as it does not verify whether the user at this time is the highest bidder.

## Vulnerability Detail

Suppose there is the following scenario:

1. Alice participates in bidding for a token.  In the final round of bidding, Alice is the highest bidder and she is about to win the auction.

2. At the end of the auction, Alice preemptively calls the `cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral` function to withdraw all her collateral from the `_withdrawCollateral` function. Alice then calls the `closeAuction` function to withdraw the auction token. These calls are executed within a single transaction, allowing Alice to win the auction successfully and free of charge.

## Impact

The user with the highest bid can win the auction for free by using the `cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral` function

Optimize the _cancelAllBids function

```solidity
function _cancelAllBids(uint256 tokenId, address bidder) internal {
    EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout
        storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();

    uint256 currentAuctionRound = l.currentAuctionRound[tokenId];

    for (uint256 i = 0; i <= currentAuctionRound; i++) {
        Bid storage bid = l.bids[tokenId][i][bidder];
        
+       require(
+           bidder != l.highestBids[tokenId][i].bidder,
+           'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Cannot cancel bid if highest bidder'
+       );

        if (bid.collateralAmount > 0) {
            // Make collateral available to withdraw
            l.availableCollateral[bidder] += bid.collateralAmount;

            // Reset collateral and bid
            bid.collateralAmount = 0;
            bid.bidAmount = 0;
        }
    }
}
```
