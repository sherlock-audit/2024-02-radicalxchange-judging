# _cancelAllBids does not check if bid is the highest

## Summary
EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal::_cancelAllBids lacks checks to determine if bids are one of the highest bids in auction rounds. This will allow highest bidder to withdraw collateral while keeping the highest bidding spot.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a bidder places a bid it has to be the highest bid, also when a bidder cancels a bid it has to not be the highest bid, these invariants protect the English Auction from bidders gaming the auction and breaking internal accounting. As the highest bid check is non existent in _cancelAllBids and as _cancelAllBids does not reset highestBids mapping accordingly, a user can place the highest bid, cancel it and withdraw collateral while keeping the highest bid.
## Impact
An adversary can get Stewardship without paying collateral to the previous Steward.
