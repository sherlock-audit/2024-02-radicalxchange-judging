# Bidders can win auction without paying

## Summary
User can make a bid and withdraw his collateral while maintaining highest bidder status. If they are the last person to bid, they will win the auction without paying.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user cancels a single bid, it is made sure that they are not the top bidder in order to avoid the said issue. This check is missing in the `_cancelAllBids` function. It makes all of the collateral withdrawable and sets the bit amount to 0 but does not remove him from the highestBids mapping. Essentially they become the top bidder with 0 bid amount.

## Impact
This essentially resets the auction back to the `startingBid` amount since in order to outbid the highest bidder users only have to put a higher bid than the `startingBid`. But if the 0 bidder is the last person to bid they will win the auction without paying anything.

## Recommendation
Make sure the address that is calling `_cancelAllBids` is not the highest bidder in any of the auctions or rounds.
