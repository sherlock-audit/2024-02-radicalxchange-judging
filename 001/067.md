# The highest bidder can get auctioned the NFT for free by canceling their bid and closing the auction.

## Summary

The highest bidder can get auctioned the NFT for free by canceling their bid and closing the auction.

## Vulnerability Detail

Highest bidders are not allowed to cancel their bid when calling `cancelBid` which checks if the caller is the highest bidder and reverts if that's the case, but that check does not exist in `_cancelAllBids`, which allows the user to cancel of all of their bids, including the highest ones, which is where the venerability lies. As a result, when the auction ends, the highest bidder can call `cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral` and then `closeAuction`, which would allow the bidder to receiver their collateral back, and still hold the spot of the highest bidder and then get NFT transferred to them. In the case if other bidders haven't withdrawn their collateral, the auction fee will be taken from their collateral, which can lead to them losing some or all their funds, otherwise, the attacker can send the fee amount either by bidding using another account or using `selfdestruct`.

## Impact

Auctioned NFTs can be stolen, and bidders can lose some or all of their collateral.

## Tool used

## Recommendation

Implement checks in `_cancelAllBids` to prevent the highest bidders from canceling their bids.
