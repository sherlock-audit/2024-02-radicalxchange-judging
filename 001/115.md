# cancelAllBids might be impossible to be called due to OOG

## Summary
`cancelAllBids` iterates over all rounds since start and might cause an OOG issue 

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the contract, user can withdraw all of the funds they've bid on certain tokenId by calling `cancelAllBids`. The problem is that this function iterates over all rounds since the beginning and it doesn't matter whether the user has participated in those rounds or not. After some time has passed and many rounds have passed too, this function will be impossible to be called as it will have to iterate upon hundreds/ thousands of rounds, effectively causing a DoS due to Out-Of-Gas error.

```solidity
    function _cancelAllBids(uint256 tokenId, address bidder) internal {
        EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout
            storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();

        uint256 currentAuctionRound = l.currentAuctionRound[tokenId];

        for (uint256 i = 0; i <= currentAuctionRound; i++) {
            Bid storage bid = l.bids[tokenId][i][bidder];

            if (bid.collateralAmount > 0) {
                // Make collateral available to withdraw
                l.availableCollateral[bidder] += bid.collateralAmount;

                // Reset collateral and bid
                bid.collateralAmount = 0;
                bid.bidAmount = 0;
            }
        }
    }
```
