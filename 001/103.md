# Bidder with highest bid can cancel their bid and withdraw collateral

## Summary
The bidder with the highest bid has the ability to cancel their bid in the current round.

## Vulnerability Detail
The highest bidder can call the `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.cancelAllBidsAndWithdrawCollateral` function to cancel all bids and withdraw collateral,  taking into account the current round.
This is because the internal function `_cancelAllBids` cancels all bids, including the current round:
```solidity
function _cancelAllBids(uint256 tokenId, address bidder) internal {
        EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.Layout
            storage l = EnglishPeriodicAuctionStorage.layout();

        uint256 currentAuctionRound = l.currentAuctionRound[tokenId];

-->     for (uint256 i = 0; i <= currentAuctionRound; i++) {
            Bid storage bid = l.bids[tokenId][i][bidder];

            if (bid.collateralAmount > 0) {
                // Make collateral available to withdraw
                l.availableCollateral[bidder] += bid.collateralAmount;

                // Reset collateral and bid
                bid.collateralAmount = 0;
                bid.bidAmount = 0;
            }
        }
    }
```

## Impact
The highest bidder can cancel all bids and withdraw collateral, thus breaking the core logic of the smart contract.
