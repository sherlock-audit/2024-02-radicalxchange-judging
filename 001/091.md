# winning a bid with less funds deposited

## Summary
winning a bid with less funds deposited .Users can have a big bid amount even if they deposited less funds to the contract

## Vulnerability Detail

1.  in this line of code  `bidAmount` can be set to be greater than the `msg.value` by a user for a bid and a user can bid
with max of  `uint256` -1  they will always win the bid

```solidity 
    _placeBid(tokenId, msg.sender, bidAmount, msg.value);
```

## Impact
user with less funds can win a bid

## Tool used

Manual Review , slither ,fuzz testing

## Recommendation
1. subtract `bidamout` from `msg.value` when making a bid and when user cancels bid add it back to the collateral


2. add this to the to code 

```diff
    function placeBid(uint256 tokenId, uint256 bidAmount) external payable {
        require(
            _isAuctionPeriod(tokenId),
            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: can only place bid in auction period'
        );
        require(
            !_isReadyForTransfer(tokenId),
            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: auction is over and awaiting transfer'
        );
        require(
            IAllowlistReadable(address(this)).isAllowed(msg.sender),
            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: sender is not allowed to place bid'
        );
+          if(bidAmount> msg.value) revert();

             _placeBid(tokenId, msg.sender,  bidAmount, msg.value);
    }
     
```
