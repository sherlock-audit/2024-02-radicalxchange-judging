# The Highest Bidder can steal the collateral and win the auction without paying

## Summary
Because of not checking the bidder of the bid being canceled canceling in `EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal::_cancelAllBids`, the Highest bidder can cancel his Bid keeping himself as the Highest Bidder.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a Bidder wants to cancel his Bid using `EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal::_cancelBid`, the function provides a check to prevent the Highest Bidder from canceling his Bid. And this is a must to prevent him from taking his `collateralAmount` and winning the Auction without paying.

[auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L393-L396](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L393-L396)
```solidity
    function _cancelBid( ... ) internal {
        ...

        // @audit The Highest can not cancel his Bid
        require(
 <@         bidder != l.highestBids[tokenId][round].bidder,
            'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Cannot cancel bid if highest bidder'
        );

        ...
    }

```

But in `EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal::_cancelAllBids`, this check is missing. besides, it takes the `currentAuctionRound` into consideration. 

```solidity
    function _cancelAllBids(uint256 tokenId, address bidder) internal {
        ...

        // @audit this loop even take currentAuctionRound in consideration
        for (uint256 i = 0; i <= currentAuctionRound; i++) {
            Bid storage bid = l.bids[tokenId][i][bidder];
           
            if (bid.collateralAmount > 0) {
                // @audit No checking if this Bid is the Highest Bid or not
❌️              l.availableCollateral[bidder] += bid.collateralAmount;
                ...
            }
        }
```

This means anyone even the Highest Bidder of the `currentAuctionRound` can cancel his Bid using this function, and this behavior should not occur to prevent stealing collateral as we discussed earlier.

This will make the Highest Bidder (Attacker) withdraw his collateral (`ETH`) before the end of the auction, and when closing the Auction, the following will occur.

1. The Highest Bidder (Attacker) will receive the token without paying anything.
2. The `oldBidder` (Owner of the token), will gain nothing, and lose his token. 
3. The `Beneficiary` will not gain his fees for that Auction Period.


## Impact
1. The Highest Bidder (Attacker) will receive the token without paying anything.
2. The `oldBidder` (Owner of the token), will gain nothing, and lose his token. 
3. The `Beneficiary` will not gain his fees for that Auction Period.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Prevent the execution of the function if the caller (Bidder) is the Highest bidder of the current round.
