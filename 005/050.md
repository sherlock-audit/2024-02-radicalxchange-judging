# Auction can't immediately restart when no bids were made for an auction

## Summary

When an auction fails to garner any bids, the token will be repossessed. When this occurs, the token will be locked up for the license period duration. This forces users who want to purchase tokens to wait for the license period to end before a new auction can start. 

License periods should only apply to token bidders as repossessors only act as a temporary token owners in between non-active auction rounds.

## Vulnerability Detail

When an auction is closed (EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal._closeAuction()), the currentLicensePeriod value is set as:

```solildity
// Set lastPeriodEndTime to the end of the current auction period
uint256 licensePeriod = IPeriodicPCOParamsReadable(address(this))
    .licensePeriod();

l.lastPeriodEndTime[tokenId] = block.timestamp;

// AUDIT: licensePeriod is set to current license period.
l.currentLicensePeriod[tokenId] = licensePeriod;
```

The auction start time is calculated for the next round as follows:

```solidity
function _auctionStartTime(
    uint256 tokenId
) internal view returns (uint256 auctionStartTime) {
   ...
  // Auction starts after licensePeriod has elapsed
  auctionStartTime =
      l.lastPeriodEndTime[tokenId] +
      l.currentLicensePeriod[tokenId];
    ...
}
```

Based on the code above, the auction start time is calculated as ` l.lastPeriodEndTime[tokenId] + l.currentLicensePeriod[tokenId]`. This leads to a situation where regardless of the results of the auction, the new auction round will start after the current license period is complete.

## Impact

Potential bidders will have to wait for at least the license period duration before a new token auction round begins.

## Recommendation

If a token is repossessed, set the currentLicensePeriod to 1. This will allow for a new auction to start in the next block allowing bidders to not have to wait X amount of time for the new auction round to begin.
