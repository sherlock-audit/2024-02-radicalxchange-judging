# Bidder can take the place of the highest bidder without having a bigger bid

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
When a new bid is placed, if there is already a highest bid, there is a [check to ensure that the new bid place will be bigger then the current bid plus the minimum bid increment](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L307-L312), the `minBidIncrement` can have the value 0, fact that will allow a bidder to add a bid wit the exact same value as the bid before hand taking the place as the highestBid but without actually adding any extra value.

## Impact
Take the place of the highest bid bidder without outbidding him.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either add a check to ensure that `minBidIncrement` can not be 0 or add the following code :
```diff
if (l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound].bidAmount > 0) {
+         if(l.minBidIncrement > 0 ) {
                  require(
                      bidAmount >=
                          l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound].bidAmount +
                              l.minBidIncrement,
                      'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Bid amount must be greater than highest outstanding bid'
                  );
+         } else {
+                 require(
+                      bidAmount >
+                          l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound].bidAmount +
+                              l.minBidIncrement,
+                      'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Bid amount must be greater than highest outstanding bid'
+                  );
+          }      
}
```
