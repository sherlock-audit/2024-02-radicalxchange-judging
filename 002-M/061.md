# Repossessor will receive `bidAmount` of closing round

## Summary
When a round ends with no bidders the NFT is transferred to the `repossessor`. A future round closing with a bid will transfer the bidded funds to the `repossessor`.

## Vulnerability Detail
When an auction round ends without bidders the NFT is transferred to the `repossessor`. After the `licensePeriod` expires a new round starts and users are able to bid again. If the round is closed with at least one bid [the `bidAmount` will be transferred to the previous owner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L500-L501), in this case the `repossessor`.

This results in the `repossessor` profiting from auction rounds ending without bidders when a following round is closed with at least one bid.

## Impact
The `repossessor` profits but he shouldn't.

## Recommendation
Funds should be sent to the `initialBidder` instead.
