# Auction fails if the 'Honorarium Rate' is 0%

## Summary
The Honorarium Rate is the required percentage of a winning Auction Pitch bid that the Steward makes to the Creator Circle at the beginning of each Stewardship Cycle. 

`$$ Winning Bid * Honorarium Rate = Periodic Honorarium $$`

To mimic the dynamics of private ownership, the _Creator Circle_ may choose a 0% _Honorarium Rate_. However, doing so breaks the functionality of the protocol.
## Vulnerability Detail
To place a bid, a user must call the [`placeBid`](https://github.com/RadicalxChange/pco-art/blob/4acd6b06840028ba616b6200439ce0d6aa1e6276/contracts/auction/facets/EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.sol#L153) function in `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.sol` and deposit collateral(`collateralAmount`) equal to `bidAmount + feeAmount`. The `feeAmount` here represents the _Honorarium Rate_ mentioned above. 
The `placeBid` function calls the [`_placeBid`](https://github.com/RadicalxChange/pco-art/blob/4acd6b06840028ba616b6200439ce0d6aa1e6276/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L286) internal function in `EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol` which calculates the  `totalCollateralAmount` as follows : 
```solidity
uint256 totalCollateralAmount = bid.collateralAmount + collateralAmount;
```
Here, `bid.collateralAmount` is the cumulative collateral deposited by the bidder in previous bids during the current auction round(i.e, zero if no bids were placed), and `collateralAmount` is the collateral to be deposited to place the bid. However the `_placeBid` function requires that `totalCollateralAmount` is strictly greater than `bidAmount` if the bidder is not the current owner of the _Stewardship License_. This check fails when the `feeAmount` is zero and this causes a _Denial of Service_ to users trying to place a bid. Even if the users try to bypass this by depositing a value slightly larger than `bidAmount`, the [`_checkBidAmount`](https://github.com/RadicalxChange/pco-art/blob/4acd6b06840028ba616b6200439ce0d6aa1e6276/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L338) function would still revert with `'Incorrect bid amount'`

## POC
The following test demonstrates the above-mentioned scenario :

```solidity
 describe('exploit', function () {
    it('POC', async function () {
      // Auction start: Now + 100
      // Auction end: Now + 400
      const instance = await getInstance({
        auctionLengthSeconds: 300,
        initialPeriodStartTime: (await time.latest()) + 100,
        licensePeriod: 1000,
      });
      const licenseMock = await ethers.getContractAt(
        'NativeStewardLicenseMock',
        instance.address,
      );

      // Mint token manually
      const steward = bidder2.address;
      await licenseMock.mintToken(steward, 0);

      // Start auction
      await time.increase(300);
        
      const bidAmount = ethers.utils.parseEther('1.0');
      const feeAmount = await instance.calculateFeeFromBid(bidAmount);
      const collateralAmount = feeAmount.add(bidAmount);

      // Reverts when a user tries to place a bid
      await expect( instance
        .connect(bidder1)
        .placeBid(0, bidAmount, { value: collateralAmount })).to.be.revertedWith('EnglishPeriodicAuction: Collateral must be greater than current bid');

      
    
      const extraAmt = ethers.utils.parseEther('0.1');
      const collateralAmount1 = feeAmount.add(bidAmount).add(extraAmt);
      
      // Also reverts when the user tries to deposit collateral slighty greater than bid amount
      await expect( instance
        .connect(bidder1)
        .placeBid(0, bidAmount, { value: collateralAmount1 })).to.be.revertedWith('EnglishPeriodicAuction: Incorrect bid amount');  
      
      // Only accepts a bid from the current steward
      
      await expect( instance
        .connect(bidder2)
        .placeBid(0, bidAmount, { value: 0 })).to.not.be.reverted;

    });
  });
```
To run the test, copy the code above to `EnglishPeriodicAuction.ts` and alter [L#68](https://github.com/RadicalxChange/pco-art/blob/4acd6b06840028ba616b6200439ce0d6aa1e6276/test/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuction.ts#L68) as follows : 
```diff
-          [await owner.getAddress(), licensePeriod, 1, 10],
+          [await owner.getAddress(), licensePeriod, 0, 10],
```
Run `yarn run hardhat test --grep 'POC'`
## Impact
The protocol becomes dysfunctional in such a scenario as users as DOS'd from placing a bid.

## Recommendation
Alter [EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol::L#330](https://github.com/RadicalxChange/pco-art/blob/4acd6b06840028ba616b6200439ce0d6aa1e6276/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L330) as follows :
```diff
- totalCollateralAmount > bidAmount,
+ totalCollateralAmount >= bidAmount, 
```
