# Auction can't be extended when block.timestamp is at auction's end

## Summary

When a user places a bid on an auction, EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal._isReadyForTransfer() is called. This function will return true when the block.timestamp equals the auction end time. However, the _placeBid() function allows bidders to place a bid and extend the auction when the block.timestamp equals the auction end time.

This logic error results in the user not being allowed to place a bid at the auction end time and extending the auction. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal._isReadyForTransfer() can be seen below:

```solidity
function _isReadyForTransfer(uint256 tokenId) internal view returns (bool) {
    if (tokenId >= IStewardLicense(address(this)).maxTokenCount()) {
        return false;
    }
    // AUDIT: note that this logic will result in the function returning true.
    return block.timestamp >= _auctionEndTime(tokenId);
}
```

This function is called in EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.placeBid():

```solidity
function placeBid(uint256 tokenId, uint256 bidAmount) external payable {
    require(
        _isAuctionPeriod(tokenId),
        'EnglishPeriodicAuction: can only place bid in auction period'
    );
    require(
        !_isReadyForTransfer(tokenId),
        'EnglishPeriodicAuction: auction is over and awaiting transfer'
    );
    require(
        IAllowlistReadable(address(this)).isAllowed(msg.sender),
        'EnglishPeriodicAuction: sender is not allowed to place bid'
    );

    _placeBid(tokenId, msg.sender, bidAmount, msg.value);
}
``` 

If the block.timestamp equals the auction end time, then _isReadyForTransfer() will return true, which will revert the placeBid() function.  

This results in bidders at the auction end time from submitting new bids. This is in contradiction to the logic in _placeBid that allows bidders to extend the bid at the auction end time.

## Impact

Bidders at the time of the auction end will not be able to bid on the auction and extend it.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The _isReadyForTransfer function should update the operator logic to `>` to allow users to make bids at the auction end time and extend the auction. 

```solidity
function _isReadyForTransfer(uint256 tokenId) internal view returns (bool) {
    if (tokenId >= IStewardLicense(address(this)).maxTokenCount()) {
        return false;
    }
    //slither-disable-next-line timestamp
    return block.timestamp > _auctionEndTime(tokenId);
}
```
