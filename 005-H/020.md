# Protocol funds can be drained by auctioned NFT's owner using 2 wallets

## Summary
Protocol funds can be drained by auctioned NFT's owner by transferring it between 2 addresses.
## Vulnerability Detail
If an owner of an auctioned NFT wants to bid on the auction, they only need to put down enough collateral to cover the fees for the bid amount they are making:

```solidity
    if (bidder == currentBidder) {
        // If current bidder, collateral is entire fee amount
        feeAmount = totalCollateralAmount;
```

```solidity
    require(
        _checkBidAmount(bidAmount, feeAmount),
        'EnglishPeriodicAuction: Incorrect bid amount'
    );
```

The issue is that the NFT owner can use a secondary address to leverage this in the following way (let's assume fee is 10% for simplicity):

1. Alice is the owner of the auctioned NFT, she makes the first `bidAmount` of 100 (sends 10 collateral for fee)
2. Alice transfers the NFT to Charlie
3. Charlie bids with `bidAmount` of 200 (sends only 20 collateral for fee since this is now the new owner addr)
4. Charlie transfers the NFT back to Alice
5. Auction ends, Charlie wins with highest bid 200
6. Charlie is different from `oldBidder` (current owner of token) and the highest bidder, so Charlie's winning `bidAmount` of 200 is [transferred to Alice's collateral balance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/459dfbfa73f74ed3422e894f6ff5fe2bbed146dd/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L500-L501) in `_closeAuction()`
7. NFT is transferred to Charlie

In that scenario, the total collateral put down by Alice using both her addresses is 30 collateral, but she receives (200 - collateralForFees), and also retains the NFT. In the end, Alice profits off of the protocol's balance. Her profit is `(bidAmount - totalCollateralForFees)`. The bids can be repeatedly raised higher and higher using 2 wallets until enough `bidAmount` is accumulated to drain the contract's funds.
## Impact
Protocol & user funds will be drained.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Bidding logic is just flawed for auctions, deeper refactoring of the code is needed.
