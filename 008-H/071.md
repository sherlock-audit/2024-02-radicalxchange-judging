# Auction rounds cannot be closed if the fee distribution call reverts

## Summary
Auction rounds cannot be closed if [distribute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/beneficiary/facets/IDABeneficiaryFacet.sol#L69) reverts.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function [_closeAuction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L465) transfers ETH fees to creator circle by calling the [distribute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/beneficiary/facets/IDABeneficiaryFacet.sol#L69) function:
```solidity
// Distribute fee to beneficiary
if (l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound].feeAmount > 0) {
    IBeneficiary(address(this)).distribute{
        value: l.highestBids[tokenId][currentAuctionRound].feeAmount
    }();
}
```

[distribute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/beneficiary/facets/IDABeneficiaryFacet.sol#L69) calls the out-of-scope [IDABeneficiaryInternal::_distribute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/beneficiary/IDABeneficiaryInternal.sol#L78-L89) function, which performs two other external calls:
```solidity
l.token.upgradeByETH{ value: value }();
l.token.distribute(0, value);
```

There are some issues in this flow that might make the call revert preventing the auction from being closed, new rounds from starting and the NFT from being transferred:
- Both external calls are performed on `l.token` which implements the `upgradeByETH()` function but doesn't implement the `distribute()` function, making the call revert and bricking the auction process. (This can be verified in the `ISETH` interface of which `l.token` is an instance).
- Superfluid uses upgradable proxies in their contracts, meaning the smart contract code could be changed at any time making these functions revert for any new reason (the README specifies that external protocols are RESTRICTED).


## Impact
Auction rounds might be bricked because of reverts on the [distribute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/beneficiary/facets/IDABeneficiaryFacet.sol#L69) call, preventing the auction from being closed, new rounds from starting, the NFT from being transferred and the auction fee from being distributed.

## Recommendation
Wrap the [distribute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/beneficiary/facets/IDABeneficiaryFacet.sol#L69) call in a `try/catch`, cache the fee amount to be distributed when the `catch` is triggered and add a function to manually distribute the cached amount.
