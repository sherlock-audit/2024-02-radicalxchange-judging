# initializeAuction Function can be front run

## Summary
The `initializeAuction` function in the `EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet` contract lacks access control, potentially allowing unauthorized parties to frontrun and  initialize the auction parameters.


## Vulnerability Detail
The `initializeAuction` function does not have any access control modifiers, such as `onlyOwner` or `onlyRole`, which means any external account can frontrun this function to initialize the auction parameters. This can lead to unauthorized modifications of critical auction settings by malicious actors.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that unauthorized users can interfere with the auction process, potentially disrupting the fairness and integrity of the auction.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement access control mechanisms such as role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict the initializeAuction function to only be callable by authorized addresses. This ensures that only trusted parties can initialize the auction parameters and mitigates the risk of unauthorized modifications.
