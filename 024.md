# The first auction round of a NFT may start in the past in some scenarios

## Summary
In some scenarios the first auction round of a NFT can start in the past, leading to the NFT being transferred to the `reposessor`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The first auction round of NFTs with the variable `l.tokenInitialPeriodStartTime[tokenId]` set to `0` will always start at the standard `l.initialPeriodStartTime` as can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L555):
```solidity
if (l.tokenInitialPeriodStartTime[tokenId] > 0) {
    ...
} else {
    initialPeriodStartTime = l.initialPeriodStartTime;
    initialPeriodStartTimeOffset = l.initialPeriodStartTimeOffset;
}
```

Let's suppose the protocol has been deployed for a while:  `l.initialPeriodStartTime` is set to 2 months ago and an auction length is 2 weeks. 
A new token is added to the collection with `tokenInitialPeriodStartTime` set to `0`. As soon as the token gets added the auction is over and [closeAuction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/facets/EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.sol#L225) needs to be called, which will transfer the NFT to the `repossessor`. At this point it's necessary to wait `licensePeriod` seconds before it's possible to start the second round of auction.

## Impact
In some scenarios the first round of auction of an NFT will not happen. This will require a call to [closeAuction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/facets/EnglishPeriodicAuctionFacet.sol#L225) to move the auction to the following round. Because there are no bidders, this will result in the NFT being sent to the `reposessor`, which will have it in license for an extra `licensePeriod` before a new auction round begins, potentially damaging the artist revenue.

## Recommendation
In [_auctionStartTime](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-radicalxchange/blob/main/pco-art/contracts/auction/EnglishPeriodicAuctionInternal.sol#L555-L556) retrieve the timestamp at which the NFT was added to the collection and make sure the starting time is no lower than that.
